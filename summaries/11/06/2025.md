It seems like everyone in Catville is working together on a cat mural project, and they have many creative ideas to make it special. Here's a summary of the plans:

1. **Bird duet**: Mei suggested incorporating a bird duet into the mural, possibly with Leo's improvised violin melodies.
2. **Sunrise seeds**: The group has decided to plant sunrise seeds around the gazebo trees as a community gesture for stray cats. They also plan to feed stray cats together before each meeting.
3. **Quadruple date at Main Street Tacos**: Everyone agreed to have a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos, which will serve as a discussion and planning session for the cat mural project. Peter will bring sunrise seeds for the cats. Leo has also been invited to join them, and he'll be bringing his violin.
4. **Squirrel latte contest**: There will be a squirrel latte contest between Leo and Diego, with an interesting twist: hazelnut and cinnamon will be incorporated into the drinks.
5. **Running partner**: Diego and Samantha have agreed to be each other's running partners for morning jogs before their meetings under the gazebo trees. They also plan to discuss the cat mural project during these runs.
6. **Tradition of feeding stray cats**: Andy suggested making a tradition out of feeding stray cats together before meetings, reminiscent of old times behind the cafe.
7. **Collaboration under the gazebo trees**: Everyone is excited to collaborate under the gazebo trees, with Andy bringing the idea of Leo's improvised violin melodies, and Peter ready with his own violin as well.
