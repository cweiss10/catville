It appears that several groups of people in the town of Catville are collaborating on various projects, particularly a cat mural project. They have been discussing different ideas and elements to incorporate into the mural, such as latte art, science elements, music, and archiving. Some of them also plan to bond before their meetings by feeding stray cats together or having team activities like quadruple dates at Main Street Tacos or relaxing evenings at the theater. They are looking forward to these collaborative sessions under the gazebo trees, which seems to be a popular meeting spot in Catville.
