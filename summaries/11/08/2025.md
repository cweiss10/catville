It seems like everyone in Catville is excited about a collaborative project involving a cat mural and feeding stray cats. Here's a summary of the current plans:

1. A group of people including Andy, Samantha, Peter, Mei, Diego, Caroline, and Leo are planning to meet under the gazebo trees at 8 PM to discuss the project and feed some stray cats.

2. They will also have a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos to further plan the project. The exact timing for this date is not specified, but it's likely happening soon.

3. The cat mural design will incorporate sunrise seeds, an idea proposed by Caroline and discussed with Diego and Leo.

4. There are plans for musical performances under the gazebo, with Diego on the violin, Caroline singing, and possibly Leo contributing as well.

5. Andy suggested a morning meeting at the community center to discuss further ideas for the project. The exact timing for this meeting is not specified.

6. Everyone seems to be passionate about helping the stray cats in Catville.

This sounds like a wonderful initiative! I wish everyone the best of luck with their collaboration and hope that they can make a positive impact on the community's feline friends.
