It seems that everyone in Catville is collaborating on various projects centered around cats and the community. Here's a summary of their ongoing plans:

1. Community Garden: Mei is bringing seeds for the community garden, which will be discussed further at Main Street Tacos on Thursday.
2. Mural Project: Andy suggested meeting with Caroline, Samantha, Diego, and possibly Noor to discuss the cat-themed mural project at El Charro, also on Thursday. They plan to save some tacos for neighborhood strays.
3. Cat-Themed Concert: Leo's squirrel tunes will be incorporated into a cat-themed concert with involvement from kids from the community center and some bird duets performed by others. The final plans will be discussed on Thursday at Main Street Tacos.
4. Cat-Inspired Yoga Sessions: Peter and Samantha have planned yoga sessions that may include cat-inspired poses, with routines to complement each other during the sessions.
5. Quadruple Date at Main Street Tacos: Diego, Mei, Andy, and possibly Noor are meeting for a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos on Thursday to discuss their respective projects.
6. Cat Project at Town Hall: Noor is working on a cat project with Peter at the town hall, but specifics about this project were not mentioned in the conversation logs.

Thursday seems like an exciting day for the residents of Catville as they come together to collaborate and celebrate their shared love for cats!
