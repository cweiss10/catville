It seems like everyone in the town of Catville is collaborating on various creative projects, all centered around cats! Here's a summary of some ongoing initiatives and plans:

1. **Cat Mural at El Charro:** Leo is working on bird tunes that he plans to weave into this mural. Caroline, Andy, and Mei are excited to collaborate on this project.

2. **Cat-Themed Park Performance:** Andy has suggested incorporating a yoga session before rehearsals for this performance. The group discussed this idea over dinner at Main Street Tacos.

3. **Cat Feeding Station:** Peter and Noor are working together on building a feeding station for stray cats, which could potentially be incorporated into the cat mural design.

4. **Cat-Inspired Stretching Routine:** Samantha and Diego have decided to collaborate on this fitness project as well. They plan to finalize details over some tacos at Main Street Tacos and feed cats together behind Caroline's Caf√©.

5. **Community Garden:** Caroline reminded Mei about bringing seeds for the community garden on Thursday, presumably during their scheduled meeting at Main Street Tacos.

It appears that Main Street Tacos serves as a central gathering place for these collaborations!
