It seems like everyone in Catville is collaborating on various projects, and they are all planning to meet under the old oak tree. Here's a summary of their plans for tomorrow:

* Andy, Samantha, Diego, Noor, Leo, and possibly Peter will be discussing the cat mural project, watering systems, and integrating latte art with the community garden theme at 10 AM under the old oak tree.
* Andy suggested that Leo could contribute his rhythm to their project, and they might have an improvised duet with Stray-13 and Peter's violin.
* Diego will be discussing cat food samples for the strays during the meeting.
* Caroline will bring chamomile tea for everyone.
* Later in the day (around 3 PM), Diego suggested another meeting under the old oak tree to discuss watering systems with Noor.

Everyone seems excited about these collaborative projects, and they are looking forward to making something unique together!
