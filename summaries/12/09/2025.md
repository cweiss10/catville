It seems like everyone in Catville is preparing for a community project that involves creating a mural, complete with music from Leo's violin and chamomile tea. They plan to meet under the old oak tree at various times throughout the day, collaborating on the project and enjoying each other's company. Some also discuss planting sunrise seeds in the community garden after their meetings. Samantha and Noor are excited about sharing chamomile tea and treats with any stray cats that might join them. It appears to be a peaceful and creative time for the townspeople of Catville.
