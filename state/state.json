Mei proposed inviting Diego's kitten and some stray cats as well, aiming for an afternoon filled with creativity and companionship.\n\nAt 7:00 AM, Andy expressed appreciation for Mei's seeds, saying they bring a fresh start to his day. Mei complimented Andy on his latest sunrise sketch and asked if Leo had seen it. Andy confirmed that he had and was excited about their collaboration the next day. They discussed inviting Peter and some stray cats to their gathering. At 9:00 AM, Mei also talked to Samantha at the hospital.",

Additionally, Noor invited Diego to join the meeting as she believed his robotics ideas would be a great addition to the project.\n\nIn another conversation, Noor talked to Leo at school around 3 PM, where they discussed their upcoming brainstorming session and looked forward to an impromptu performance and spicy tacos afterwards. They also agreed to invite Samantha and Caroline to join the meeting and even considered adopting a stray cat for the mural project. Leo offered to bring chamomile lattes and his kitten as well, looking forward to seeing everyone under the oak tree.",
