Noor agrees and offers to bring snacks for everyone, including Peter and the EMTs.

Everyone agrees to contribute new ideas to their cat mural project and stray cat feeding efforts, with potential incorporation of music into these events, especially a mini bird duet suggested by Caroline between her and Leo.\n\nLeo proposes a warm-up session at Main Street Tacos tonight at 8 PM, which Caroline accepts. In an additional conversation with Leo at the gym, Caroline suggests inviting him to play the violin during their cat feeding session under the gazebo trees on Sunday. Leo enthusiastically agrees to this collaboration and proposes a bird duet between them.\n\nSamantha secured some sunrise seeds from Peter for their hospital piece, and Caroline has finalized treats for the cats on Sunday, inviting her cafe friends to help out. Diego expresses interest in trying Mei's squirrel latte art, while Caroline shares Andy's sketches for the cat mural with Leo, who thinks they're amazing and looks forward to their collaboration.\n\nIn another conversation, Caroline talks to Peter at school around 7 PM, where she is excited about Peter joining their cat mural project and discusses a potential quadruple date beforehand. Peter suggests using the sunrise seeds for the design and expresses gratitude for inviting Mei for stray cat feeding. They both look forward to connecting more with everyone on this project.",

They also agreed to save some food for the stray cats.\n\nLeo suggested grabbing dinner together after rehearsal at Main Street Tacos, which Noor agreed to. Around 3:00 PM, Diego discussed with Noor their plans to meet up at Main Street Tacos that night to brainstorm on the latte art idea and cat mural project. They also mentioned discussions with Mei, Andy, and Peter at the hospital.\n\nAround 4:00 PM, Noor talked to Andy at school. Andy proposed turning the cat mural project into a team bonding activity with stray cats. Noor agreed, and they planned to meet under the gazebo the next day to discuss further, bringing snacks for everyone including Peter and the EMTs. They also discussed feeding the stray animals before their meeting on Sunday, and Andy suggested a bird duet under the gazebo.\n\nNoor agreed to join in discussing the bird duet, and they decided to involve Sunrise Seeds Incorporation. They also planned a brainstorming session that night before dinner at Main Street Tacos, inviting Leo, Mei, and Diego for this quadruple date. Looking forward to it, Noor agreed to these plans with Andy.",
