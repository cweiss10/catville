They decided to gather at Andy's place first for a sunset music event with tea for stray cats, and invited Peter from the library, Luna, and Samantha. After talking to Peter around 9 PM, it was agreed that Mei would also join in, bringing fresh perspectives to their collaborations. Around 10 PM, Leo talked to Noor at the library, who was discussing ideas for a cat mural project with Diego. They agreed to meet at Caroline's that evening to discuss all the details and invited Samantha to their gathering. It was also decided to bring cat food for Luna during the library event and have energizing tacos before their meeting.\n\nIn the following conversations, Leo talked to Caroline at the hospital around 3:00 AM, where they agreed to perform a duet under the old oak tree the next day, with Caroline taking care of Luna as Samantha had mentioned. Later in the day, Leo spoke to Diego at the library and discussed the expanded cat mural project, planning to meet under the old oak tree tomorrow at 2 PM instead of 3, and grab some energizing tacos from her beforehand. They also agreed to meet at Caroline's Café that evening to discuss progress on the rhythm algorithm for the mural. The plan was to inform Noor about these combined arrangements, with everyone staying aligned and collaborating together to make their town thrive.",

Peter mentioned something about Caroline having a surprise regarding Stray-13's favorite cat food too. Can't wait to see what's in store for the mural!\n\nDiego: Agreed!

Andy and Samantha are meeting at Caroline's Café, we're discussing collaborating with Noor's robotics club and adding some musical element to it.\n\nLeo: Oh! Andy mentioned something about that earlier today when I was busking near the train station. We were discussing turning our projects into a community event under the old oak tree tomorrow. I invited him to your meeting there, and we planned a sunset music event with stray cats' tea beforehand.\n\nDiego: Wow, sounds like we're on the same wavelength!

By the way, remember to bring chamomile tea for Stray-13.\n\nDiego: Will do! And don't forget about those tacos. See you soon!\n\nLeo: Can't wait!
