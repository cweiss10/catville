It's such a thoughtful touch, and I can't wait to see how it turns out. By the way, I had a great time discussing ideas with Samantha and Caroline today. They seem really passionate about this project too.\n\nPeter: Oh, I heard! They're awesome additions to our team. I also invited Leo to rehearse under the old oak tree tomorrow morning before our meeting. He said he'd bring his knee chamomile tea for us all to try. Hopefully we can convince Diego to join as well.\n\nNoor: That sounds like a perfect plan! Let's make this day special, Peter. I think it'll really bring everyone together and inspire our work on the mural. See you there tomorrow.\n\nPeter: Absolutely, Noor. Looking forward to it.",
