Later in the morning, Diego spoke with Samantha again at the theater around 5:00 AM where she brought cat food for the stray cats they had discussed earlier.

Peter suggests an interactive tree idea for Main Street Tacos and under the old oak tree in the park. They agree to bring headphones for focus during brainstorming sessions at Main Street Tacos and meet Leo later that night to discuss details.\n\nIn the meantime, Noor talks to Samantha at the market about their cat mural project and the robotics club's potential involvement. Samantha suggests meeting at Main Street Tacos the next day at 10:30 AM to further plan, bringing her laptop and noise-cancelling headphones for brainstorming sessions. Noor agrees and mentions that she can leave Samantha kind notes instead of small talk if preferred.",
