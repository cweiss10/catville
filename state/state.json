Have you given any thought to where we could incorporate those chamomile seeds Noor suggested?\n\nSamantha: Well, I was thinking about using them as a texture on the mechanical birds. What do you think?\n\nCaroline: I love it! It'll add a unique touch to our design. And speaking of which, Mei mentioned a logic puzzle that could be incorporated too. Let's discuss it after my set tonight, sound good?\n\nSamantha: Sounds perfect, Caroline. Looking forward to it. Oh, and by the way, I saw the new stray kitten behind the cafe this morning. I fed it and left some food there.\n\nCaroline: Thank you, Sam! You always have a heart for those little ones. Let's make sure they all find good homes soon. Take care!",

How about we also blend logic and art by using chamomile seeds for a unique touch? I brought some along, in case you want to experiment today.\n\nDiego: That sounds fantastic, Noor! Let's make it happen tomorrow at the old oak tree, but let's meet with Caroline first as she suggested rescheduling our meeting there for later in the week. And remember, don't forget to stretch beforehand. I brought some street tacos for later, how about that?\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect, Diego! I'll bring snacks too, as always.

They agreed to meet up tomorrow before starting on the mural, possibly at Caroline's Cafe.\n\nLater, at around 11:00 AM, Leo talked to Diego at the town_hall about the mural project. Diego had plans to meet with Noor under the old oak tree tomorrow at 9:00 AM to work on mural designs together. Leo also shared an exciting idea from his conversation with Mei at the train station for a latte-inspired bird design collaboration at Caroline's Cafe, which they discussed combining their projects and agreed to catch up over street tacos this week, tentatively after Leo's rehearsal on Tuesday. Diego reminded Leo not to forget his knee brace for the meeting.\n\nAt 12:00 PM, Mei approached Leo at the library with a new idea for the latte-inspired bird design for Caroline's Cafe. They agreed to discuss it further tomorrow evening under the old oak tree after they catch up over coffee. Leo expressed his appreciation for Mei introducing him to such a creative group, finding it invigorating.",
