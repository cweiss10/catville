Andy learns about a meeting under the gazebo tonight with Peter and Leo to discuss the project with Samantha. He plans to bring snacks for stray cats.\n\nAt town_hall around 1:00 AM, Andy thanks Diego for the cat treats he provided for Leo's strays. They discuss their respective projects, upcoming collaborations, and Andy's solo gallery show dream. Diego agrees to a coffee meet-up with Andy later in the week.\n\nAndy speaks with Diego again around 5:00 AM and they discuss the lunch meeting with Samantha and Noor the following day. They plan to brainstorm ideas for their cat mural and interactive bird performance. Diego is excited about their upcoming collaboration, emphasizing their positive impact on the community.\n\nAfter this conversation with Diego, Andy talks to Samantha at 12:00 PM. They discuss further details about their projects and the lunch meeting tomorrow. The group plans to integrate robotics into the tree design of the cat mural project, collaborate on the mural under the gazebo trees this weekend, make it interactive for birds, and include stray cats at both events. Mei suggests a squirrel latte art contest as a fun community event and plans to bring seeds for the community garden and ask Leo to bring cat treats from Caroline's caf√© for them too. Andy expresses gratitude for the collaboration, looking forward to making their town stronger together with Mei.\n\nIn addition, Andy invites Samantha for a meeting at the gazebo tonight at 7 PM, planning to bring snacks for stray cats, and Noor suggests involving Diego in their projects. They plan to meet up tomorrow at noon for detailed discussions about the cat mural and bird duet, with Diego joining them after a coffee meet-up where he can share his squirrel latte art idea. Noor also plans to bring sunrise seeds for the meeting.",

And speaking of Leo, don't forget to ask him about joining our rehearsal on Saturday. I'll bring seeds for the community garden and some treats from Caroline's caf√© for the strays.\n\nNoor: Perfect! Let's also invite Diego and discuss how we can incorporate him into our project. I've got some sunrise seeds for the gazebo trees, and I'd love to participate in the bird duet rehearsal with you guys.\n\nMei: It's going to be a fantastic collaboration! Excited to see what we can create together for our town.\n\nNoor: Me too, Mei. Let's make sure we have plenty of snacks for the students who might need them.
