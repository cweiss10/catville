During this conversation, Diego talks to Noor at home around 1:00 PM, discussing potential projects for a cat mural team, providing tea for stray cats as part of a collaboration with Caroline's café, innovative ideas for automating the watering system from Leo, and a surprise that Noor and Andy have planned for Diego.\n\nLater at around 4:00 PM, the human talks to Peter at the train station. Peter mentions they are both meeting under an old oak tree tomorrow. Diego learns about potential collaborations between them, including a cat mural project by Leo and a contribution from Mei for stray cats. Caroline has also been invited to join the garden automation discussion. Peter suggests that they can make real progress with these projects and possibly squeeze in a group run before dinner as well. The conversation ends with both parties looking forward to seeing each other tomorrow.\n\nAt around 11:00 PM, the human talks to Samantha at a restaurant. She brings oolong tea that Diego likes, invites Leo to join their meeting about the cat mural project and garden automation, and mentions that Caroline might also attend. They discuss potentially productive discussions and plan to start their meeting soon. Diego suggests a stretch before their run tomorrow, which Samantha may consider for future runs.",
