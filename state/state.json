Andy appreciated Mei's enthusiasm and unique ideas, looking forward to more collaborations.\n\nAt 4:00 AM, Mei spoke to Peter at the town hall about incorporating robotics for mechanical birds in their project. They decided to discuss further under the old oak tree after lunch and plan to make it a memorable event. Peter also invited Mei to work out together sometime.\n\nMei reminded Peter about chamomile seeds for Samantha's garden, to which Peter agreed. Peter appreciated Mei's ideas and looked forward to their collaboration.",
