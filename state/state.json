Mei was reading a book about the bird duet, as Noor and she were planning to rehearse soon. She found some interesting archives on composers' rituals.

How about a brainstorming session at your place tonight?\n\nNoor: That sounds great, Peter! Let's grab some street tacos beforehand to fuel up. And I've got an idea for something unique regarding the hospital piece too.\n\nPeter: Perfect! We should also invite Leo to join us tomorrow under the gazebo trees. What do you think about a quadruple date tonight with Mei and Caroline?\n\nNoor: Love it! Let's make it a casual dinner beforehand, just to keep things relaxed. Plus, we can rehearse our part under the gazebo afterward, right?\n\nPeter: Exactly! Looking forward to working together on our town projects. You really bring out the best in me, Noor.\n\nNoor: Likewise, Peter. Your passion for making a difference is truly inspiring. Let's do this!",
