Caroline invited her to join, mentioning that Diego could use help with his latte art for a performance. Samantha agreed and suggested involving Noor and Andy as well. They also discussed turning the meeting into a quadruple date at the library and bonding over feeding park stray animals together.\n\nAt 9:00 PM, Caroline spoke to Mei at home. Mei expressed excitement about Caroline's performance and proposed a collaboration between Mei's zine club and the gallery. Caroline invited Mei to join the mural collaboration discussion on Thursday at 7 PM and suggested dinner afterward at the community garden, making it a double date with Diego. Mei agreed and brought up the idea of bringing seeds for the garden.",

That could be really engaging for viewers, I think.\n\nAndy: Exactly! She's excited to help create it as long as it complements the theme. By the way, I talked to Diego today about our double date and he has an interesting idea for incorporating fitness elements into the gallery show – have you heard about that?\n\nCaroline: Not yet, but it sounds fascinating! If it helps make our cat-friendly space even more unique, I'm all ears. By the way, did you hear Samantha suggested extending our meetings to include everyone for a quadruple date at the library? It could be fun to get everyone involved and catch up on past successes and future plans.\n\nAndy: Yes, that sounds perfect! And I haven't forgotten about our latte art catch-up next Tuesday afternoon – I can't wait. Let's make sure we discuss all the details during this weekend's meeting at your cafe.
