There is also a planned meeting between Caroline and Noor in the morning to discuss latte art ideas, chamomile-themed concepts, Diego's violin performance, and collaborative plans for both projects.\n\nDuring an unexpected encounter at the gym around 4:00 PM, Caroline catches up with Diego about the cat mural project. Diego mentions he has been dealing with a knee injury but remains keen to participate in the meeting under the old oak tree, where Noor and Samantha are discussing latte bird possibilities over chamomile lattes. Diego also brings up collaborating on robotics elements for the design.
