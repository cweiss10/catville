We're having a creative gathering at Caroline's Café tomorrow, and I was hoping to run some ideas by you.

Diego proposes a meeting over street tacos after Leo finishes busking that night.\n\nAt the theater around 12:00 AM, Samantha offers her programming skills to join their creative projects, specifically the rhythm-based algorithm. Leo invites her for a discussion over tacos at Main Street the following day.\n\nAt the gym around 1:00 AM, Andy discusses the improv duet ideas for the mural with Leo, and they agree to meet with Diego, Noor, and possibly Mei at Main Street Tacos the next day to finalize details.
