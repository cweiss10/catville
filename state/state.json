By 1:00 AM, he spoke to Leo at the library and proposed a new idea for the event at the theater, which they agreed upon. At 3:00 AM, Andy talked to Caroline at the park about involving her in the project as she would be bringing her theater group and discussed a tea party under the old oak tree. By 4:00 AM, Andy talked to Mei again about adding bird-themed zines from her zine club to decorate the area at the tea party. They agreed on adding a cat mural to the plans as well.\n\nAt 7:00 AM, Andy spoke to Caroline at a restaurant and proposed involving her theater group in the community event. She accepted the proposal and they discussed meeting up before the event to finalize the details. Andy promised to text her about the meeting times with Mei and Samantha later that day. At 9:00 AM, Andy spoke to Peter at a cafe and discussed their ongoing collaboration on the community event, suggesting involving Noor for a healing melody performance at the event and during the tea party under the old oak tree. Peter agreed, and they planned to meet later for chamomile lattes to further discuss and plan the details of the event.\n\nAt 12:00 PM, Andy met with Leo at school. Andy thanked him for meeting up and discussed their project plans, which included involving Noor and her healing melody from the hospital and inviting Peter from the museum. They agreed to meet later for street tacos and finalize everything over chamomile lattes, and Leo suggested bringing his violin for improvisations as well.",
