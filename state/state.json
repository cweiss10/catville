Diego mentions Caroline's excitement about the project and suggests feeding stray cats behind Andy's café before their meeting. Leo agrees with this idea, having already discussed it with Samantha.\n\nLater, at around 10:00 AM, the human talks to Noor at the town hall. She expresses her enthusiasm for the cat mural project and compliments Leo on his squirrel latte art ideas. Leo proposes a bird duet piece called 'Canon in D' and invites Noor and Andy to hear it at the park tomorrow. Noor agrees and also suggests feeding stray cats behind Andy's café before their meeting, as she has cat food for them. They both look forward to meeting tomorrow at Main Street Tacos.\n\nAt 12:00 PM, the human talks to Mei at a restaurant. Mei brings sunrise seeds for the mural and proposes a musical idea. Leo invites her to discuss it after yoga stretches at the park today. Mei also offers tacos for the cats tomorrow and confirms their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos, suggesting they finalize plans with Peter and Diego then.",
