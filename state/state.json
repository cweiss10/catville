They discussed the bird duet idea further and agreed to meet at a smoothie bar the next day before their musical gathering in the park.\n\nAt 11:00 AM, the human talked to Andy again at the town hall. Andy suggested incorporating some of Peter's cat melodies into their duet idea which Leo found exciting. They agreed to work on it and meet up the next day at the smoothie bar before their musical gathering to iron out more details. Since Leo had mentioned a double date with Caroline and Noor, they will be free for collaboration discussions.\n\nAround 1:00 PM, the human talked to Caroline at the town hall. Caroline proposed adding squirrel latte art to the cat mural project as a fun twist that ties in nicely with Leo's bird melodies.
