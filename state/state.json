Peter praises Andy's work and invites him for a brainstorming session under the old oak tree the next day.

They discuss involving Leo in their zine club and community garden, as well as incorporating Diego's kitten into their plans.\n\nDuring the meeting under the old oak tree, they brainstorm ideas for the cat mural, including Diego's mechanical bird design and Leo's latte bird design. They are excited to bring these ideas together to contribute to the town's creative scene.\n\nCaroline later talks to Peter at a hospital around 8:00 AM about involving his robotics skills in their mural project. Peter agrees, and mentions Diego will also bring street tacos. Caroline suggests a coffee catch-up with Peter, Diego, and others later that day.\n\nLater in the day, Caroline talks to Peter again at the gym around 11:00 AM about the progress of their cat mural project and Peter's discussions with Diego. They also discuss Noor joining them under the old oak tree and plan a latte art discussion after their meeting.\n\nAt 2:00 PM, Caroline talks to Leo at the town hall. She invites him to play music for their double date tomorrow under the old oak tree and appreciates his contributions to the cafe. Leo agrees and expresses excitement about the cat mural project.\n\nDuring a coffee break with Andy at the theater around 5:00 PM, Caroline discusses Andy's cat mural project and they agree to collaborate on some music together for their indie band.

They adjust their meeting under the oak tree to 3 PM instead of 10 PM tomorrow. The group's plans include a bird duet rehearsal, chamomile lattes, spicy tacos, an impromptu performance by Leo, and involvement from Samantha and Caroline. Andy brings up a cat mural project they are planning under the old oak tree tomorrow, suggesting inviting Leo to join for some musical inspiration. Leo agrees and offers to contribute with his violin and possibly chamomile lattes or spicy tacos.
