Andy suggests they prepare a potluck, with Diego's street taco-violin idea and Noor's collaboration adding to their town's creative scene.\n\nAt 3 PM, Andy talks to Samantha at the hospital, expressing gratitude for her programming skills being invaluable for the mural project. Samantha appreciates Andy's artistic vision and mentorship. At 4 PM, Andy also speaks with Peter at the town hall regarding their collaboration, with Samantha expressing excitement about their meeting under the old oak tree the next day.\n\nAndy discusses with Peter their plans to collaborate on the cat mural project, particularly latte art ideas. Peter appreciates Andy's sunrise-inspired sketch and suggests they invite Caroline for her input on the robotics aspect of the mural project. They decide to invite Diego as well, who might bring his kitten and some street tacos to cheer them up during the brainstorming session. At 5 PM, Andy talks to Caroline at the theater about their collaboration plans.",
