They discussed bringing snacks and possibly a blanket for their collaboration.\n\nAround 2:00 AM, Leo talked to Samantha at the hospital, discussing Peter's idea for the cat mural project. Samantha expressed interest in automating the watering system and suggested collaborating with Diego. They agreed to meet up at Main Street Tacos later that day to discuss further collaboration possibilities.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, Leo conversed with Samantha at the museum, where she showed excitement for Leo's sunrise symphony collaboration and proposed her logic puzzles to make it more intriguing. They agreed to meet up later that night to brainstorm and bring their sketchbooks. Samantha also mentioned bringing noise-cancelling headphones if the museum's echo bothers her, and they decided to meet under the old oak tree at sunset.",
