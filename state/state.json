Noor also proposed this collaboration, suggesting that Leo performs with her and they should incorporate Leo's rhythm-based algorithm into their project. They also discussed trying chamomile tea under the old oak tree for the stray cats and planned a double date with Samantha and Peter. The conversation ended with excitement for another great collaboration.",

And I heard you've been moonlighting as an indie singer at the theater. How's that going?\n\nCaroline: It's going great! In fact, I was hoping you might join me for a duet sometime. What do you think?\n\nLeo: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Let's do it soon. I've always admired your ability to connect people and keep the cafe's cozy vibe.
