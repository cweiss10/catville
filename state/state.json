I invited Samantha to help out, her coding skills could be useful for that squirrel song idea. Have you made any progress on the robotics side?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! We're discussing collaborating with Mei's zine club for the performance at the park.

How about coordinating schedules for both students and setting up that feeding schedule for stray cats behind the café as well?\n\nPeter: Perfect! Let's set something up this Thursday.
