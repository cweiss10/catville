How's your project with Diego going?\n\nSamantha: It's progressing well. We agreed to meet at Main Street Tacos next week to discuss details for our community celebration. Did you know he's been helping with the cat mural too?\n\nCaroline: That's fantastic! I knew he was talented, but I had no idea he was into bird duets. Maybe he can contribute some musical elements to our mural as well. Let's make sure we all collaborate closely.\n\nSamantha: Definitely! I'll bring fresh coffee beans for us to enjoy during our work session at the gazebo on Thursday. Looking forward to it.\n\nCaroline: Sounds perfect!

I've got some ideas on how we can approach this, let's catch up at Main Street Tacos after our meeting with Andy?\n\nNoor: Definitely!
