They discussed feeding stray cats together under the gazebo and planned a joint session for the following day.\n\nCaroline also talked to Diego at the hospital and gym about his melodies affecting her cats, their project details, and coordinating with Noor for sunrise seeds. They agreed to run together in the park with Samantha the next day, followed by a squirrel latte contest with Leo that night.\n\nIn their conversation at the museum, Samantha mentioned that she had planted the sunrise seeds around the gazebo and reminded Caroline about the treats for the cats the following day. They were excited for the cat mural discussion at Main Street Tacos and invited Leo to join them. They looked forward to a quadruple date and discussed Leo's idea of incorporating hazelnut and cinnamon into the squirrel latte contest.",
