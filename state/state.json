They also talked about providing fresh cat food for Stray-13, and continued their discussion about the mural project during their conversation with Peter at the museum around 7:00 AM.\n\nLater, Leo spoke to Caroline at the train station around 11:00 AM, sharing his new tunes for the meeting under the old oak tree, which included Samantha's participation and Peter's ideas for the watering system. Both were excited about the collaboration, looking forward to their upcoming meeting with fresh cups of tea, and a double date at Main Street Tacos this weekend.",
