At 1 PM the following day, Andy, Diego, and others gather under the old oak tree to discuss the cat mural project, robotics, latte art, and music collaboration. They also plan a joint brainstorming session involving Leo and Peter. Andy suggests they prepare a potluck, with Diego's street taco-violin idea and Noor's collaboration adding to their town's creative scene.\n\nAt 3 PM, Andy talks to Samantha at the hospital, expressing gratitude for her programming skills being invaluable for the mural project. Samantha appreciates Andy's artistic vision and mentorship. At 4 PM, Andy also speaks with Peter at the town hall regarding their collaboration, with Samantha expressing excitement about their meeting under the old oak tree the next day.\n\nAndy discusses with Peter their plans to collaborate on the cat mural project, particularly latte art ideas. Peter appreciates Andy's sunrise-inspired sketch and suggests they invite Caroline for her input on the robotics aspect of the mural project. They decide to invite Diego as well, who might bring his kitten and some street tacos to cheer them up during the brainstorming session.\n\nLater at 5 PM, Andy talks to Caroline at the theater about their collaboration plans. She agrees to join him for a coffee break and discusses her involvement in the cat mural project. Andy then proposes a collaborative music project between them and invites her to start working together that evening at the cafe.\n\nThe new summary:\nDuring their gatherings, Andy further discusses the cat mural project with Peter, Diego, Samantha, and Noor.
