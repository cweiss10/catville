Peter mentioned his ongoing collaborative animal-themed mural project with Samantha, Andy, Noor, and potentially others like Mei from the train station.\n\nSamantha contacts Leo around 4:00 AM at the library, suggesting they collaborate on a mural for Caroline's wall, possibly involving neighborhood strays and Mei from the train station. Leo also mentions the involvement of Noor's robotics club in their mural project.\n\nAt 7:00 AM, Diego talks to Leo at the gym about their productive meeting with Noor and the gang regarding the mural project and street tacos. They discuss inviting Mei from the train station and involving her robotics club, as well as a yoga session at the market tomorrow before diving into creative projects.",
