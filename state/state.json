On Tuesday, they will discuss Diego's stretching techniques for the mural work at the museum. They are enthusiastic about keeping their collaboration strong and making their double date casual yet stylish as suggested by Diego.\n\nAndy subsequently discussed the mural project with Samantha over the phone and proposed a pre-meeting coffee discussion at El Charro tomorrow morning at 9 AM to discuss her yoga ideas for the cat nook design. They also plan to try a new taco spot in Main Street for their double date this weekend and catch up more at Samantha's usual spot behind the cafe on Saturday.\n\nLater, Andy spoke with Mei at the train station around 11 PM, suggesting a coffee meeting before their meeting on Friday to discuss Noor's yoga ideas for the mural design. Mei agreed and suggested discussing ideas for the community garden meeting too. They decided to make it a quadruple date with Diego and Samantha, as well as considering Main Street for great tacos this weekend.\n\nMei also mentioned her conversation with Noor about joining the robotics club, suggesting she could help implement some tech elements in their mural. Both Andy and Mei are excited for Thursday's quadruple date and discussion.\n\nAndy then talked to Caroline at theater around 2:00 AM. She needed his artistic touch for their community garden project and suggested involving Diego as well. They agreed to meet up at El Charro on Thursday and also invited Noor to join the discussion. Andy proposed feeding the park stray animals after their meeting as a nice touch for the project, which was agreed upon by Caroline. Both parties are excited about this collaboration.",

I spoke with Leo about it too, and he suggested involving his robotics club members in a respectful way for the community garden. What do you think?\n\nMei: It sounds like a great idea! Let's plan to discuss that further during our coffee meetup on Thursday. By the way, Diego mentioned Caroline's creative input at the train station - maybe we can coordinate with them too?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! I also had an idea for incorporating a yoga session into the mural. Can't wait to hear what you think about it during our meeting.
