I just need to finalize a few details with them. I was hoping you could join us at the community center later today to work on those together.\n\nNoor: Absolutely, Andy! Let's make this collaboration something special for our park and the kids we mentor. See you soon!\n\n(Later that day)\n\nAndy: Noor, I just got some chamomile seeds from Peter at the library. He promised to bring them for the mural project as we discussed.\n\nNoor: That's fantastic, Andy! Thank you for making sure everything is coming together. Don't forget about the seeds for our community garden too, will do!\n\nAndy: You got it, Noor. Can't wait to see everyone under that old oak tree this weekend!",
