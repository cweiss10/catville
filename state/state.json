An appealing idea of an improvised duet between Mei's local bird choir and Leo was proposed, which she found appealing. They agreed to make the collaboration happen together.\n\nAround 9:00 AM, Leo talked to Caroline at the market about their musical ideas for the mural garden. He had been working on mechanical bird designs and suggested combining Caroline's latte art with his mechanical birds during the collaboration under the oak tree in the park. Caroline found this idea fantastic, proposing they also involve Noor and her robotic birds. They discussed an impromptu duet between Noor and Leo under the sunrise sketch, looking forward to the collaboration.",
