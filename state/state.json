They agreed to meet at different times during the day and suggested incorporating Caroline's squirrel latte blend in their friendly competition for the quadruple date.\n\nLater, Leo had conversations with both Andy and Diego about the cat mural project. With Andy, they discussed the squirrel latte contest as a potential fun addition to their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos. Leo then spoke to Diego at the market around 8:00 AM, where they agreed to collaborate on the cat mural project under the gazebo, incorporating violin music, improvisational sessions with birds, and inviting Noor and Andy to join them.\n\nAt 2:00 PM, Leo had another conversation with Diego at the library, where Diego expressed interest in the squirrel latte contest and offered to show off his amazing latte designs for the cat mural project. They also made plans to feed stray cats under the gazebo trees before starting the project. Later that day, around 4:00 PM, Leo talked to Mei at school. She had her seeds ready for the gazebo trees and reminded him about bringing his violin for their meeting under the gazebo at sunset. They also discussed feeding stray cats before beginning the project, eagerly looking forward to making music and creating something magical together.",
