Peter suggests involving Diego in their conversations and events.\n\nIn a separate conversation around 3 AM, Andy talks to Caroline about the cat mural project, praising her unique purple hair against the sunrise during their morning run. Caroline mentions she missed him at the gazebo event yesterday but discusses their new ideas including a duet of violin and sunrise sketches that they plan to meet to discuss tonight at 6 PM.\n\nCaroline informs Andy that Diego will also be joining them, along with Noor who is scheduled to meet Peter later in the day for further collaboration discussions. Andy asks Caroline if she has gathered chamomile for the stray cats yet and makes plans to see her at the gazebo tonight. They agree on bringing their respective talents (sketchbook for Caroline) to help make the cat mural a success.",
