They discussed a possible performance at Main Street Tacos with Leo bringing his violin to make music with birds while interacting with stray cats. They reminisced about old conversations regarding this idea.\n\nAt 6:00 AM, Leo played a moving serenade inspired by the sunrise for some stray cats in the park. Later that day, he spoke to Mei at a restaurant who suggested sharing his new melody with her Saturday zine club that night.\n\nLater that evening, after playing the melody for the zine club, Leo talked to Mei again at home about his day's events, including Noor's interest in joining the stray cats' jam session. Mei proposed a collaboration between Caroline and Leo for their cat mural project, which they agreed to discuss further over dinner the next day at Main Street Tacos.\n\nDuring an 11:00 PM conversation at the train station, Leo received news from Caroline about Andy and their plans to collaborate on the cat mural project under the gazebo trees. They also discussed a jam session after their meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow, with Noor's involvement and a proposed duet between Caroline's violin and Leo's guitar.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, Leo spoke to Mei at a cafe. Mei expressed interest in Leo sharing his sunrise melody with her zine club tonight, which he agreed to do. They also discussed using the sunrise seeds in their brainstorming sessions before collaborations start. Both are looking forward to further discussions and collaborations.",
