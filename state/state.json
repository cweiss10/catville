Later that day, plans are made to involve Noor in discussions under the old oak tree and include chamomile tea during the meeting. The following day, around 4:00 AM, Mei talks to Peter about these details. He mentions planning a run under the old oak tree before their work session.\n\nMei also discusses Samantha's involvement at the market around 5:00 AM. They agree to meet at Main Street Tacos first, with plans to bring old instruments and chamomile tea for the cats. Stray-13 is suggested to be involved more in the project. Mei also proposes a double date as a bonding experience for all involved parties. The cat mural project continues to progress with the involvement of key participants.",
