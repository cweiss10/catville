Andy informed him about meeting Leo under an old oak tree and discussing the project, including a cat mural for the event mascot. Diego suggested they incorporate their passions into the get-together and serve street tacos as well.\n\nAndy also mentioned speaking with Mei earlier in the day about chamomile lattes at the afternoon meeting at the community garden, which she seemed enthusiastic about. Diego reminded Andy to invite Samantha to the event, as she had interesting ideas for their project.
