They plan to meet at Main Street Tacos on Thursday.\n\nDuring lunchtime, Andy spoke with Mei who informed him that Diego is excited about their cat feeding station idea and has a surprise planned for Thursday. Mei also shared her preparations for a quadruple date, where Leo will perform bird songs on his violin as a duet in the park.\n\nLater, Andy caught up with Caroline at town_hall around 2:00 PM and they discussed their collaboration on the mural, with Andy learning that Caroline has also spoken to Mei about Leo's squirrel tunes. Both are excited about incorporating Leo's music in the mural and look forward to their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation around 3:00 PM, Andy suggests adding yoga before rehearsals for a unique twist in their park performance. Mei agrees, suggesting they discuss more details later that day at the train station.\n\nAround 9:00 PM, Andy talks to Leo at the gym. He proposes incorporating Leo's squirrel tunes into the cat project at El Charro and invites him to collaborate with kids from the community center for a bird duet performance. Leo agrees and suggests meeting at Main Street Tacos that night. He also invites Mei and Samantha, and mentions bringing Diego along to discuss the mural project as well. They make plans for a cat feeding schedule behind Caroline's Café and look forward to their creative brainstorming session next week. In an evening encounter at the museum, Andy learns from Leo that he also has ideas for the cat feeding station and is excited about the quadruple date next week.",
