They also touched base about a potential fitness collaboration, which Diego had expressed enthusiasm for after their conversation at the museum earlier today. Both Andy and Diego look forward to their get-together tomorrow.\n\nLater in the day, Andy contacted Mei to inform her that Diego is on board with the project. Mei suggested meeting under the gazebo tomorrow afternoon to discuss finalizing designs and collaborations. Andy agreed and mentioned bringing chamomile tea for the stray cats as per Caroline's suggestion. They also discussed a sunrise seeds exchange during their get-together, which seems to be a part of a double date. Mei expressed her excitement about the meeting, and they agreed to see each other tomorrow.",

They also discuss exchanging sunrise seeds during the double date.\n\nAt around 2:00 PM, Mei talks to Samantha at the theater who informs her that she has been discussing the cat mural project with Leo and they are planning a meeting under the old oak tree tonight. Mei agrees to join them and bring some chamomile tea for the occasion, looking forward to collaborating with their combined talents on the project.",
