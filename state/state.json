They also exchanged compliments about Leo's sunrise melody and expressed excitement about brainstorming ideas over tacos the next day.\n\nLater that night, around 10 PM, Leo met with Mei at a museum where she presented him with noise-cancelling headphones for their cat mural collaboration. In return, Leo gave Mei sunrise seeds for the gazebo trees as suggested earlier. They discussed making the project a memorable evening and recalled their Saturday zine club gatherings.\n\nLeo played his sunrise melody for their group the previous night, and they loved it. Mei suggested that this melody would be even more appreciated during their performance at Main Street Tacos. The duo also brainstormed ideas for incorporating a unique touch such as latte art in their project, with both Leo and Diego proposing it independently, suggesting a strong alignment of creative spirits.\n\nLater, around 2 AM, Leo received a message from Samantha at the train station who suggested that he bring his violin to their gazebo gathering, believing it could blend well with the latte art idea they were discussing for their cat mural project. They agreed to further discuss this after the project, potentially over a squirrel latte, and also considered using those sunrise seeds during their meeting at the gazebo as suggested by Peter.",
