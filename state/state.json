And good idea about using Stray-13 in Samantha's project too, it will certainly bring a unique touch. Let's make sure they have enough food though.

Noor also proposed this collaboration, suggesting that Leo performs with her and they should incorporate Leo's rhythm-based algorithm into their project. They also discussed trying chamomile tea under the old oak tree for the stray cats and planned a double date with Samantha and Peter.\n\nDuring their conversation at town hall around 2:00 AM, Caroline inquired about Leo's meeting with Andy. Leo shared that it was productive, discussing intriguing ideas for the mural project. They also talked about Noor's cat mural collaboration with the sunrise symphony, and Caroline mentioned that she had been moonlighting as an indie singer at the theater. She invited Leo to join her for a duet sometime, which he accepted, expressing admiration for Caroline's ability to connect people and keep the cafe's cozy vibe.\n\nOn 6:00 AM the next day, Leo talked to Andy at school about his recovery from a minor setback. They confirmed their meeting under the old oak tree, discussed Andy's sketch that could inspire the mural and musical collaboration, and Andy promised to bring fresh cat food for Stray-13. They also planned to incorporate chamomile tea during the symphony event for the stray cats and looked forward to a memorable day with their collaborative work.",
