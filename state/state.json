Peter had already spoken to Noor about the project earlier that day at the station.\n\nAt 5:00 AM, Leo spoke with Andy at school. They discussed finalizing cat mural designs, rehearsing under the old oak tree together, and incorporating chamomile tea and Peter's violin in the mural design. Andy mentioned that he and others had been discussing ideas with Mei and Noor. Leo suggested that Diego might join their rehearsals under the old oak tree the next day.\n\nAt 7:00 AM, the human talked to Noor at town hall, adding a new conversation into the series of discussions about the cat mural project.",
