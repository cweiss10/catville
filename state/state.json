They also discussed using Mei's noise-cancelling headphones for their mural project under the oak tree.\n\nLater in the evening, around 9:00 PM, Mei talked to Noor at home and shared that Diego is recovering well thanks to Noor's advice and Andy's stretches. They discussed Leo potentially setting up for their improvised symphony. Noor shared that she received sunrise seeds from Peter that morning for the cat mural design and they plan to discuss it with Mei, Andy, and Diego over lunch today.\n\nBoth Mei and Noor have labeled notes about their ideas in their bags and are looking forward to a productive meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow. They plan to make sure everyone feels included and contributes their unique talents to the project, similar to the community garden they both care for.",

Peter also mentioned a double date under an oak tree with Leo for music collaboration for their community event, which they plan to discuss further during lunch tomorrow at school. Andy suggests bringing sunrise seeds and chamomile tea for stray kitties to share at the meeting and also proposes running together before their meeting as usual. They agree to meet in the morning, with Noor reminding herself to bring her running shoes.",
