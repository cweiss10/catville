Peter then reveals that Mei will meet at the library later. In another conversation at the train station around 3:00 AM with Noor, Andy learns that more people are joining their meeting, including Mei and her friends who wish to collaborate on his cat mural project. Diego has Leo's sketch for the cat mural, and they plan to ask him about bringing street tacos for lunch. The tradition of chamomile latte is also maintained. Andy suggests bringing seeds for the community garden.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation at 5:00 AM with Mei at home, Andy proposes that her zine club could contribute unique flair to their mechanical bird project, which Mei agrees to. They discuss meeting at the library's engineering and arts book corner later for further discussions. Andy also asks if Mei has informed Peter about the tea party under the old oak tree, to which she hasn't yet, but Andy plans to invite him. They look forward to various events and collaborations strengthening their friendships.",
