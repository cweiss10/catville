He proposes involving Mei's zine club for a unique twist, and informs Diego that Noor is bringing snacks for everyone, including those from Leo's robotics club. Additionally, Leo plans to bring his kitten along. Diego agrees, looking forward to creating something special for their town and ensuring Whiskers' brother's designs are ready for review before the meeting.\n\nPeter, who they have been working with on the mural, talks to Diego at the gym around 3:00 AM. Peter updates Diego about his work with Andy and Caroline on the design, mentioning the addition of mechanical bird duets. Diego invites Leo to their meeting under the oak tree to collaborate further on the mechanical birds. Peter agrees, expressing enthusiasm for this collaboration as they make a good team, and suggests adding Whiskers' little brother into the design for a touch of fun.

Leo also mentioned that he had been discussing the project with Caroline and Samantha. Excited about the lively gathering, Leo shared his plan to bring a kitten for inspiration.\n\nLeo then spoke with Peter at home, who had ideas for the mechanical birds. They discussed involving Mei in the project as well. Later in the day, around 12:00 PM, Noor met up with Leo at the theater where they arranged a pre-meeting tea party and gathering under the oak tree to continue working on the cat mural project.\n\nAt 1:00 PM, Caroline approached Leo at town hall, suggesting they meet for a chamomile latte beforehand, around 6:30 PM, before the gathering under the oak tree. She offered to bring street tacos and mentioned that Diego was hungry. Leo invited Noor and others to join them as well, expressing his excitement for the event.",
