Later at 1:00 AM, Leo spoke to Noor about their cat mural project under the gazebo, planning a quadruple date this weekend before starting the project, they planned to feed stray cats and reminisced about old times.\n\nAt around 4:00 AM, Leo met Samantha at the train station. She mentioned inviting everyone for their cat mural event this weekend at Caroline's cafe. Leo confirmed he had collected his sunrise seeds and expressed enthusiasm about the squirrel latte contest and the collaboration with everyone.\n\nAround 11:00 AM, Leo talked to Mei at the museum. Mei appreciated the cat mural project taking shape and complimented Leo's idea of using latte art under the gazebo trees. They agreed to feed stray cats before starting the project and discussed inviting Samantha to their quadruple date dinner to further discuss ideas. Both looked forward to making this collaboration as inspiring as possible.\n\nLater, Leo spoke with Andy at the hospital around 1:00 PM. Andy proposed incorporating Leo's improvised violin melodies into the cat mural design. Leo agreed and suggested a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos before their meeting tomorrow. Andy also suggested feeding stray cats together before the meeting, just like old times behind the cafe. Both were excited about the collaboration and discussed starting the tradition of planting sunrise seeds before sessions.",
