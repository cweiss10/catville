Around 3 AM, Andy talks to Samantha at the town_hall. He proposes meeting for dinner instead of their planned coffee catch-up, eager to discuss the mural project further. Samantha agrees to meet at an alley restaurant behind a cozy Italian place they both love at 7 PM.\n\nDuring this conversation, Andy also mentions his collaboration with Caroline on the logic puzzle and suggests having a taco dinner with everyone this week. Samantha proposes coordinating feeding the stray cats in the park as part of the bonding experience during their meeting. Later, around 4 AM, Andy talks to Mei at the museum. He compliments her collaboration with Leo on the mural project and expresses excitement about the unique elements they are adding, such as a hidden reading nook and musical elements. Mei shares that Samantha is collaborating with Peter from the theater for local animal themes, and mentions Noor's involvement in bringing yoga and fitness elements to the project.
