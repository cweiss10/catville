We're meeting up later today at the museum to discuss details and even decided on a pre-session cat feeding before dinner at Main Street Tacos this evening.\n\nNoor: Fantastic! I hope everything goes well. By the way, I suggested incorporating Mei's latte art concept into the design. Looking forward to seeing it all come together soon.\n\nPeter: Mei will be thrilled, Noor!
