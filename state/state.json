I mentioned it to my robotics club, and they're excited to collaborate. We should bring noise-cancelling headphones for everyone, just like you suggested at the market.\n\nSamantha: Yes, that's a great idea. And I've arranged a meeting with Diego tomorrow at Caroline's Café to discuss the rhythm algorithm for the project and collaborate on watering systems for our gathering under the old oak tree.\n\nNoor: Perfect! I can't wait for the tacos Diego promised us during the meeting. Let's make sure we all come prepared and energized for a productive day ahead!",
