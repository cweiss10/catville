Tonight at 7:00 PM, they will meet at the library to finalize city sounds for the mechanical birds project, with Andy, Leo, and Diego attending, and grabbing chamomile lattes beforehand as provided by Caroline. Afterward, they plan to enjoy Caroline's street tacos.\n\nCaroline also spoke with Mei at the market around 4:00 PM about the zine club she's working on. Mei shared a fun logic puzzle planned for their students, which ties in perfectly with their cat mural theme.\n\nAt the theater around 5:00 PM, Caroline proposed to Mei the idea of expanding their seed-gathering ritual by inviting everyone involved, including Diego and Andy. They also discussed having Leo's kitten as their charming mascot for the event and decided to continue the tradition of grabbing a chamomile latte beforehand.\n\nIn a separate conversation at the train station around 7:00 PM, Samantha suggested that Leo could join her on the mechanical bird project due to his knack for melodies. Caroline agreed and proposed they meet under the old oak tree this weekend like their chamomile latte date. They also discussed inviting Peter to help with the bird design and melodies, recalling his skills from the gym. Both women look forward to their collaborative projects.",
