They also plan to involve the robotics club in brainstorming sessions for the mural and make it interactive for kids during their performance in the park. Peter suggests incorporating logic puzzles into the design, which Leo agrees upon. The group decides to meet at El Charro this week to discuss further details over tacos.\n\nLater that day, Leo has a conversation with Andy at the park, where Andy shares his sketches for the mural and proposes inviting Noor, Peter, and Samantha for dinner that evening to discuss the logic puzzles in the design. Leo agrees and suggests involving the robotics club members as well. They plan a fun-filled day starting with a yoga session the following day before diving into the project. Leo is excited about the collaborative work ahead.",

You got any ideas for those stray cats yet?\n\nPeter: Haven't forgotten about them, promise. Samantha mentioned something about inviting Caroline to meet Diego tonight, so maybe we can discuss it further over tacos?\n\nLeo: Sounds like a plan, as long as Diego is feeling up to it. We could chat more about the cat project during our usual park duet tomorrow then?\n\nPeter: Perfect, looking forward to it. Let's make sure El Charro lives up to its taco reputation tonight.",
