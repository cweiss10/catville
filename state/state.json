Later at 6:00 PM, Leo spoke with Andy at the restaurant, who was excited to catch up over lunch and discuss mechanical bird ideas with Samantha. They decided to rehearse at the library on Tuesday.\n\nIn another development around 10:00 PM, Mei approached Leo at a train station, appreciating his music from the market earlier that day. She introduced him to an idea of a latte-inspired bird design collaboration under an oak tree at Caroline's Cafe and proposed meeting after rehearsal that night over coffee. Mei also offered to bring seeds for the project and noise-cancelling headphones for an early morning practice session. Overall, Leo's projects are progressing positively, and multiple collaborations involving music and art are underway.",
