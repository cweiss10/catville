He also proposed collaborating with Diego on stretching exercises before their meeting the next day. Additionally, Caroline mentioned that Diego was planning an early-morning run before the meeting, to which Leo agreed to participate. The discussions continued to evolve, involving more collaborations and creative ideas for their shared week of arts in the park.",
