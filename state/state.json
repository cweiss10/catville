Andy offers his support and looks forward to working together.\n\nIn another conversation with Noor at the hospital around 5 PM, they discuss plans for the chamomile-themed latte art concepts and the cat mural project.

They plan to incorporate everyone's ideas, with Noor suggesting involving her robotics club for potential interactive elements. Caroline proposes discussing this idea further with Samantha, as well as considering incorporating both their new kittens into the mural design. Additionally, Andy has expressed interest in collaborating with Noor on latte art designs for the project and plans to meet under the old oak tree at 8 AM the day after next, sharing snacks and tea during their discussion.",
