I was actually planning to meet Samantha early tomorrow for a chat about noise-cancelling headphones for the stray cats, then we can have some chamomile tea beforehand.\n\nNoor: Great idea! Let's invite Caroline too; her latte art would be perfect for our double date at the library. We could use that session to brainstorm and relax with a cuppa.\n\nAndy: You're right, Caroline's ideas are always fresh. I'll make sure she knows about it. Oh, and I invited Diego to join us as well. He has this footwork idea for our sunrise symphony project that I think you'd both appreciate.\n\nNoor: That sounds exciting! Let's meet under the old oak tree, just like old times, with our chamomile tea ready. We can run through Diego's footwork ideas and finalize plans for the mural and performance.",
