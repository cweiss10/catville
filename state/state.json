Would you like to bring your students for a quick workout?\n\nDiego: That sounds fantastic! See you there, and don't forget the street tacos and cat treats.\n\nNoor: You got it! And I'll make sure to invite Leo and Mei for our quadruple date this weekend too. Can't wait!\n\nDiego: Same here. Looking forward to discussing that squirrel latte art idea with you both. By the way, how's Peter collaborating on the mural project?\n\nNoor: He's great so far! I'm really excited about incorporating music into it. Maybe we can invite Samantha to join as well?\n\nDiego: That'd be fantastic! She's been helping me with my knee injury too, so I might ask her for some advice on flexibility exercises for our yoga movements in the mural design.",
