At 11:00 PM, Andy talks to Caroline at a cafe where he appreciates her latte art inspired by his cat mural sketches.

Leo suggested they could even improvise a duet with Noor's singing and his violin during their collaboration. Excited about this new adventure in art and friendship, Noor agreed to the plan.\n\nIn the afternoon, around 2:00 PM, Leo spoke with Mei at the museum, who complimented his improvisation with birds from earlier in the day. They discussed collaborating musically for Leo's zine club, and Mei proposed a composition inspired by stories shared by her zine group, with potential duets under the oak tree during discussions about the cat mural project. Agreeing to this collaboration, they planned to meet at 3 PM as arranged.\n\nThe new summary is: During the day, Leo discussed various projects with several individuals and made plans for creative collaborations with Mei and Noor, involving music and art under an oak tree in the park.",
