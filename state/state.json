We should probably talk about your mural too, and invite Noor for both events. How about that double date at their place tonight?\n\nCaroline: Sounds perfect! I'll ask Diego to inform Noor about our meeting under the oak tree tomorrow. Speaking of art, have you shared your idea for the musical performance with Samantha yet?\n\nAndy: Not personally, but we did discuss it during our conversation at the museum. I suggested incorporating Stray-13 into our automated watering system and she loved it! I'd love to grab a morning run with Diego beforehand.\n\nCaroline: That sounds fantastic! And good idea about using Stray-13 in Samantha's project too, it will certainly bring a unique touch. Let's make sure they have enough food though. I tried the cat food samples you gave me and it seems like they'd enjoy it.\n\nAndy: Perfect! Diego and I were also discussing different cat food options for Stray-13, so we should finalize that soon.

They also discuss incorporating logic puzzles into their mural project. Later in the night, Leo talks to Mei at home, who brings seeds for the garden, and they agree to meet under the old oak tree the next day at 3:00 PM to discuss a rhythm-based algorithm for their mural project, inspired by bird duets, and to enjoy oolong tea.\n\nIn addition, Leo talks to Caroline at town_hall around 5:00 AM. Caroline updates him on the progress of their collaborative mural project, planning to meet under the old oak tree tomorrow with Mei and Samantha to discuss it further. The group is excited about incorporating Leo's rhythm-based algorithm into the mural, and Leo expresses his eagerness for their duet at the theater as well as Caroline's enchanting voice.
