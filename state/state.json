How about a quadruple date at El Charro before Tuesday?\n\nMei: I'd love that! It was great discussing the cat nook design and the surprise event happening at Caroline's cafe on Saturday. And speaking of Caroline, we should definitely work on those logic puzzles for the mural project this weekend as planned.\n\nNoor: Absolutely!
