Samantha suggests incorporating Leo's robots into the project, imagining a violin-cat duet under an old oak tree. Caroline expresses gratitude for Samantha's tech input, and they both agree on the importance of making a positive impact on their community. The human speaks to Andy at the train station around 3:00 AM, and Peter, who had been at a hospital, meets up with Caroline before 4:00 AM to share his enthusiasm for the upcoming cat mural meeting, including tacos provided by Diego and tech input from the robotics club. Both agree to maintain the café's cozy vibe amidst the excitement. Later in the day, Andy mentions his chamomile seeds and Caroline encourages him to bring them to the café rehearsal that evening.",
