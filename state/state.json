Andy suggests organizing a gathering for street tacos to review project details, considering it a double date with Samantha. Excited about the collaboration, Leo intends to incorporate logic puzzles into the mural project after reading 'The Art of Improvisation'.\n\nIn the late hours at a cafe, Andy speaks to Mei about her ideas for incorporating stray cats into their art projects and proposes integrating her hidden reading nook concept into the mural for the gallery show. Mei agrees, looking forward to discussing it further at Andy's street taco gathering later in the day. They also plan to feed the animals before attending Mei's zine club meeting.",
