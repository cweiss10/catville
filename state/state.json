They have planned several meetings at the park, community garden, and under an oak tree.\n\nDuring one of these discussions, Leo suggests collaborating to turn the event into a musical affair, aiming for an unforgettable experience. The group decides to meet early tomorrow at the park to work on the mechanical birds before their scheduled meetings later in the day.\n\nIn the meantime, Andy and Peter have conversations. Andy expresses interest in collaborating with his mechanical birds for the cat mural event, and Peter agrees, suggesting they bring their creations together under the oak tree the following day. Andy also inquires about involving Mei's botanical expertise, to which Peter responds that he plans to discuss it with her later that evening, believing it would be a fantastic addition to the project.\n\nDuring another conversation, Andy talks to Samantha at the park around 2:00 PM. Andy is excited about Samantha joining Caroline's cat mural project and invites her to their brainstorming session under the oak tree tonight. He also inquires about finalizing the bird details with Leo, and learns that Samantha has invited him to join them at the garden this evening. Sounds like a productive night ahead for the group!",

I'll see what we can do with Noor and my busking friends regarding that. Thanks for the suggestion!\n\nMei: You're welcome! Collaboration makes for the best ideas, after all.

Later at the park around 3:00 PM, they talk about the garden, with Mei expressing excitement about the chamomile seeds. Peter reminds Mei about their workout the next morning before the mural project.\n\nIn the evening, around 7:00 PM, Mei talks to Diego at the museum about plans for their cat mural event, including a bird duet, native plants, street tacos, and inviting Samantha and Leo. They also discuss bringing stretches for a group workout beforehand. Around 8:00 PM, Mei speaks with Leo at the hospital about seeds collected from the market (sunflowers and basil) and a chamomile tea trade for their event under the old oak tree. They also mention kittens joining the event to inspire creativity. It's revealed that Noor's robotics students will be working on mechanical birds for the unique occasion.",

Later, Leo met Samantha at school, discussing mechanical birds and the inspiration from park birds for their mural. Samantha arranged a jam session with Noor's students and a few friends, and Leo was excited about this collaboration.\n\nAt 3:00 PM, Leo talked to Caroline at the museum who offered an expansion of the cat mural project focusing on the mechanical birds. Leo agreed, bringing his violin and a kitten for the collaboration. They planned to finalize details at the community garden that night. Samantha offered to bring chamomile tea for them, and Andy mentioned he'd bring a kitten.\n\nBetween 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM, Leo talked to Andy at the theater. Andy inquired about the cat mural plans, and they discussed mechanical bird melodies. Andy invited Leo to join him for some chamomile tea before they delve into the details, which Leo agreed to. They planned to meet under the old oak tree, with Leo bringing chamomole for both of them and seeds for their garden.\n\nAt 6:00 PM, Samantha met Leo at the train station. She was impressed by the sound of his violin and suggested discussing something new for the cat mural project under the museum's oak tree tomorrow. Leo agreed and invited Noor to join them. They decided to make it an event for the townsfolk.",
