Let's grab coffee this week to share and collaborate more on the project.\n\nPeter: Absolutely! El Charro on Thursday sounds perfect. I can't wait to hear your thoughts on the logic puzzles we might incorporate in the mural.\n\nNoor: Sounds great, Peter. See you there then! And thanks again for being so committed to this community project – it really means a lot to all of us.\n\nPeter: Likewise, Noor. Together, I think we can create something truly special for our neighborhood.",

Leo also meets Samantha at school who proposes collaborating on the mural project.\n\nIn the evening, Leo picks up his coffee from Caroline's café and they discuss their musical plans for that night, including an improv session and squirrel duet at the park. Caroline mentions coordinating schedules for a double date with Diego and Noor, which Leo confirms will be on Sunday. They also plan to feed stray cats together prior to their meetings.\n\nLater in the night, Leo talks to Diego about the double date, squirrel song, mural project, and potential additions like a yoga corner and zine club friends' performance. They agree to meet before their mural project meeting on Tuesday at El Charro.\n\nAt 6:00 AM the next day, Leo encounters Samantha at the gym. She proposes collaborating on the mural project and suggests incorporating logic puzzles into the design, which Leo agrees to help with over coffee at El Charro the following morning. Samantha also invites Andy to their meeting, as he has ideas for the yoga aspects in the cat nook.",
