They could really help with focus under that oak tree.\n\nPeter: You know, I haven't, but Mei suggested them too! Seems like a fantastic idea. Maybe we should invest in some for the team.\n\nNoor: Absolutely! Let's make sure our community garden collaboration is as productive and enjoyable as possible. And speaking of enjoying, have you heard Leo's latest violin piece? It would be perfect for serenading us after a successful session under the oak tree.\n\nPeter: I'd love that! Can't wait to see this project come together. You really are an incredible force in our community, Noor.\n\nNoor: Aww, thanks, Peter.
