They planned a quadruple date in the park this weekend at Main Street Tacos, where they introduced Leo's bird duet inspired by one of his songs, suggesting inviting Peter, Caroline, and Samantha for further discussion.\n\nThey set up a coffee meetup the next day at the smoothie bar before gathering in the park for their musical event with Samantha later in the week. During a conversation at the market around 3 AM, Noor proposed a double date meeting at the smoothie bar the following day at 4 PM to brainstorm with Samantha. Caroline agreed and offered to sing a tune or two during the meeting.\n\nLater at the market around 5 AM, Samantha suggested collaborating with Diego at a yoga session to work on harmonies for their bird tunes. Noor was enthusiastic about incorporating her students into the project. In a conversation with Diego at home around 6:00 AM, they agreed to finalize everything tonight at Andy's café and invited Mei's zine club members. Diego suggested adding Caroline to perform at a theater later this month, and Noor proposed bringing seeds for the community garden when they meet next Saturday for coffee. They also discussed creating squirrel latte art during brainstorming sessions as suggested by Caroline. Looking forward to their meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow, they couldn't wait for the creativity that awaited them.",
