They plan to have a meeting under the old oak tree the next day and invite Peter, Noor, Leo, Mei, and Diego for the session.\n\nIn additional conversations, Andy talks to Leo at town hall around 10:00 AM where Leo agrees to join them with his violin under the old oak tree. Andy also invites Peter and Noor for a double date. Later on, Andy talks to Caroline at home around 12:00 PM who reminds him of the chamomile tea and informs him that Samantha has agreed to bring sunrise seeds for the brainstorming session.\n\nDuring their conversation with Diego at school around 1:00 PM, Andy discusses the morning run and praises Peter's ideas for the mural. They also talk about incorporating sunrise seeds into their brainstorming session at the library tomorrow, which Mei had suggested. They also plan to discuss more about using Leo's violin in the mural design with Samantha at a café today. Diego suggests coordinating with everyone next week for the finalization of the cat mural design, as Noor is working on arrangements for their collaboration dinner and zine club members.
