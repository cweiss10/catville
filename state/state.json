The group decides to make it a potluck and plans to include a chamomile latte session for discussing the robotics elements. Andy is excited about the upcoming gathering filled with creativity and community spirit. Later, around 8:00 AM, Andy talks to Noor at school about the cat mural project. Noor expresses her excitement about Andy's idea and mentions that Diego's kitten might add a unique touch. They agree to meet under the old oak tree the next day at 1 PM. Noor also informs Andy about Peter organizing a meeting with the robotics club at Caroline's cafe the same day.",
