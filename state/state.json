Samantha suggested the community garden near the rose bushes at 10 AM, right?\n\nDiego: Exactly! And I can't wait to introduce stretching exercises during our work session. Maybe we could even collaborate more and work on that squirrel song idea you mentioned earlier?\n\nNoor: That sounds amazing, Diego! I was also thinking about a team-building event at Caroline's Café. We could help out with stray cats while discussing the project details. How does that sound to you?\n\nDiego: That's perfect! Let's definitely do it. Andy mentioned a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos on Thursday, so maybe we can catch up then. See you at the community garden tomorrow!",

Let's discuss it over dinner at El Charro tonight. Say, have you heard about Samantha's plans for strays behind the cafe?\n\nLeo: Yes, I did. She seems quite passionate about animals, and I like that in a partner. By the way, I've been thinking... would you mind if I invite her to our duet tomorrow at the park?\n\nPeter: Not at all, Leo!
