By the way, have you thought about incorporating those sunrise seeds into our design?\"\n\nAndy: \"Actually, I was just discussing that with Caroline! She suggested we involve Mei in the project too, given her unique style and archiving skills.\"\n\nNoor: \"That sounds fantastic! And speaking of collaborations, I had a chat with Samantha about it as well. She proposed bringing seeds for the stray cats as part of a magical event. What do you think?\"\n\nAndy: \"I love it! It's great to see our ideas merging together like this. Let's make sure to involve everyone, especially Leo with his violin playing.\"\n\nNoor: \"Absolutely! I can't wait for the day under those gazebo trees. It's going to be a magical event indeed!\"",
