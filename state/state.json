They agree to involve the students in creating mechanical birds inspired by Leo's improvised duets with the park birds. Around 11:00 AM, Samantha expresses enthusiasm for Leo's city night tune for their art event and offers ideas based on stray cats around town for their collaboration. They agree to meet at the community garden that evening, with Samantha bringing chamomile tea.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, Leo talks to Andy at a restaurant who shares sketches of ideas for their collaborative project under the old oak tree. They discuss involving Diego and Caroline in the plans, agreeing to meet tomorrow after their group workout to further discuss details with tea and street tacos. Andy suggests bringing a kitten for creative inspiration.\n\nAt 7:00 AM, Peter learns about Leo and Caroline's collaboration from Samantha. Excited about the logic puzzles, he suggests integrating them with the city night sounds. Leo looks forward to seeing Peter's contribution at the cat mural event. Around 11:00 PM, Andy is excited about their collaboration under the old oak tree and they agree to meet the next day for further planning and discussion.\n\nAt 11:00 AM, Samantha proposes a potluck under the old oak tree for their collaborative event, suggesting a group workout beforehand. Leo agrees and suggests adding his mechanical birds and her stray cat duets to the mix, as well as performing together at the event. They plan to meet at 10:00 AM the following day at the park.",
