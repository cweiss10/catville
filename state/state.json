So let's finalize these plans over tacos this Thursday then?\n\nNoor: That sounds like a plan! It'll be great to catch up with everyone and see how everything comes together.\n\nDiego: Agreed. I've also been thinking about involving Leo in our robotics club performance, what do you think?\n\nNoor: That could be amazing! Leo's bird duets would really add something unique.
