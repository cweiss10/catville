Caroline at school shares that an improvisational music session under the gazebo is also planned, with Leo preparing new violin tunes. Peter will suggest incorporating sunrise seeds into their squirrel latte design, which Caroline will discuss during the meeting. Everyone expresses enthusiasm about their growing collaboration.\n\nIn a conversation with Caroline at the park around 11:00 AM, Andy thanks her for connecting them with Leo and invites her to meet for dinner at Main Street Tacos that evening. They discuss their excitement about the project, including how Noor's sunrise seeds will look in the squirrel latte design and the inclusion of Leo's violin music during the improv session. Caroline reminds Andy not to forget his dented thermos. The group members remain optimistic that everything will bloom as beautifully as Mei's garden.",

        "summary": " During their conversations around different times of the day, Caroline discussed various aspects of the cat mural project with multiple individuals. At 7 PM, she spoke with Noor at a museum where they talked about Peter's suggestion to incorporate sunrise seeds into the squirrel latte designs for the cat mural project. Noor also invited Caroline to join the improv singing sessions during the contest at Main Street Tacos and mentioned that they could combine this with feeding the stray cats as part of their quadruple date run.\n\nCaroline agreed, and they decided to set a day soon for the cat-feeding initiative. They also discussed reaching out to Samantha regarding her ideas for the cat mural project sketch and shared plans to keep in touch about further details. Both parties were excited about the collaborations ahead and looked forward to an unforgettable night for their community.",

It'd be perfect if we can make the event feel like one of our old mural projects with feeding stray cats under the old oak tree before we get started.\n\nPeter: You're always full of great ideas, Noor.
