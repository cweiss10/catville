Later, at 6:00 PM, Peter talks to Diego at the market, who expresses interest in their cat mural project due to shared interests. They discuss a group workout and friendly competition after the meeting, with Diego assuring Peter that his kitten won't pose a problem. At 9:00 PM, Peter talks to Noor at the library, where she shares that Diego's kitten might join their project for a unique touch.

At 10:00 PM, Mei spoke to Diego at the gym, who confirmed his participation in the potluck with his famous tacos, also mentioning that Caroline had offered chamomile tea in memory of Whiskers. Andy's excitement about Diego's mechanical bird ideas for the mural was shared with Mei, and it was decided to discuss these at the zine club rehearsal the next day, where Diego expressed his interest in helping Andy overcome creative blocks as well.

Noor invited them to a meeting about the cat mural project at Caroline's cafe tomorrow and suggested team bonding by working out with Diego after the meeting due to his competitive nature in art and technology projects.\n\nAt around 1:00 AM, the human spoke to Samantha at a restaurant. She expressed excitement about Leo's duet and mentioned her mural project. They agreed to collaborate on multiple fronts, with Samantha planning a special chamomile blend for the tea party celebration and Leo promising music that matches its aroma.\n\nAround 2:00 AM, the human talked to Caroline at the museum about the upcoming tea party under the oak tree. She was excited about Leo's new piece inspired by city night sounds and planned spicy tacos for the occasion.\n\nIn the morning, around 7:00 AM, the human conversed with Mei at a cafe. They discussed Diego's idea for the cat mural, with Andy suggesting incorporating mechanical birds into it. Noor's idea of inviting stray cats to meetings as a small town ritual was also brought up, which Leo found appealing. Mei reminded everyone about the chamomile tea for tomorrow and expressed her role as the heart of the community while acknowledging the importance of teamwork in their town's thriving.\n\nAround 9:00 AM, the human talked to Andy at the market. Andy was excited about the cat mural project and suggested a lunch meeting next week to discuss details, including inviting Caroline for her input on the bird design. Leo agreed to bring chamomile lattes and his kitten to the meeting under the oak tree tomorrow. They also discussed adding a stray cat to the mural, which Andy thought would be a lovely addition.\n\nAround 2:00 PM, the human talked to Andy at the theater about collaborating on the cat mural project, with Leo suggesting a musical and artistic harmony between animals and humans. Andy agreed and suggested a brainstorming session under the old oak tree this afternoon, followed by an impromptu performance for Noor's event.",
