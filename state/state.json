Leo also remembers to feed stray animals before their park meeting on Saturday.\n\nAt 12:00 PM, Leo talks to Andy at a restaurant. Andy proposes double-dating with Diego this weekend, which Leo agrees to and suggests visiting Andy's gallery show as part of the plans. Andy offers a sneak peek of his artwork if asked nicely. Leo mentions he has some improbable spare parts for their projects and promises to use them wisely. Later in the day, around 1:00 PM, Leo discusses the double date with Diego at another restaurant.",

I can't wait to see what we can create together. How about meeting for street tacos tomorrow after my gym session?\n\nLeo: Sounds great Diego! Let's make it a double date with Caroline too – she'll be thrilled to hear that. And speaking of collaborations, Peter mentioned a meeting with Mei at the park on Wednesday. Shall we join him?",

I could use a bit of inspiration for my sketches too. How about grabbing lunch together this weekend and discussing everything in more detail?\n\nLeo: That sounds great, Andy! Peter invited Caroline and Diego as well, so we can talk about our projects over coffee. Plus, I was hoping to catch up with you at the community garden next week for some potential inspiration.\n\nAndy: Perfect! Looking forward to it. By the way, have you spoken to Noor about collaborating on yoga experiments and robotics for the kids' part of the mural?\n\nLeo: Yes, we did. We're planning brainstorming sessions this weekend. I think it'll be an amazing project for the community center. I can't wait to see everything come together!",
