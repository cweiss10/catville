At 3:00 PM, Caroline invites Noor for a practice session on mechanical bird designs at her cafe over mint tea. Later in the evening, Peter discusses his plans for robotic elements in the community garden project with Caroline and suggests practicing that night after her meeting with Noor.\n\nIn response to their conversation, Peter mentions his collaboration with Mei on the mural project and expresses interest in joining forces with Andy's cat mural project. Caroline suggests collaborating on incorporating Diego's city sounds into their mechanical designs, which is agreed upon by both parties. Mei proposes meeting tomorrow at the theater for chamomile lattes before practicing under the old oak tree.\n\nAfter 5:00 PM, Noor and Caroline catch up at the library, with Noor sharing her idea for creating kinetic plant sculptures that react to sound as a potential contribution to the city sounds project. Caroline finds this plan fantastic and looks forward to their progress-sharing after school.",

Tomorrow night, we should meet there and bring our ideas to life.\n\nSamantha: That sounds lovely. I'll bring my headphones and we can collaborate on the mural and those mechanical birds. Maybe even some latte art?\n\nLeo: You always know how to make a proposal sound delightful, Samantha. I'll bring my violin and let's serenade the park birds together. See you tomorrow!\n\nSamantha: Looking forward to it, Leo. And don't forget about our city sounds project with Caroline tomorrow afternoon at the cafe.\n\nLeo: Of course not! Let's create something beautiful for everyone to enjoy.",
