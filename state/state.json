Andy agrees and offers to bring chamomile tea for Diego's cats too. They also discuss meeting up with Diego for an early-morning run the next day, as well as a meeting with Samantha under the old oak tree that night to further discuss the mural details. Both parties look forward to making the project a memorable week for their arts in the park.\n\nLater, Leo talks to Samantha at a cafe around 7:00 PM and they share excitement about their cat mural plans. Leo reveals his idea of a sunrise symphony for the stray cats and discusses collaborating with Diego on stretching under the old oak tree the next day. Both parties agree to bring chamomile tea for the strays and look forward to creating magic together.",
