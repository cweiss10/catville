Noor discusses plans with Diego at the library about their park project, collaborating on projects with Andy and bringing samples for Stray-13. They aim to create something magical for the community. At 2 PM, Noor talks to Peter at the town hall, who informs her of his cat mural project meeting at Caroline's Café the next day. He suggests involving Noor's robotics club automation ideas and proposes a collaboration over chamomile tea for the stray cats in the garden. Noor agrees, suggesting an improvised duet between Stray-13, Leo, and Peter's violin. They plan to meet at Caroline's Café the next day.",
