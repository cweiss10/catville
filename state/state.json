I'll make sure to discuss this with Noor at our meeting tomorrow afternoon. Thanks for keeping me updated, Samantha.\n\nSamantha: Of course, Caroline.

They made plans for a joint brainstorming session under the old oak tree that night, and agreed to have lunch together with Diego beforehand. Both parties looked forward to a night of great music, creative synergy, and extraordinary collaboration on their mechanical bird project.\n\nMeanwhile, Leo met Mei at her home, where she invited him for a cup of mint tea under the old oak tree to discuss details of their mural and mechanical birds project. Mei inquired about Leo's conversation with Samantha regarding the city sounds project, and Leo shared Samantha's enthusiasm for the mechanical bird design and her idea of incorporating a serenade from park birds.
