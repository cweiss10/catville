At 1:00 PM, Mei met up with Andy at the library to discuss the upcoming event and share ideas for collaboration on their respective projects. Later, at around 3:00 PM, Mei spoke to Leo at the gym about the zine club gathering and proposed a mini-zine corner. Leo expressed interest in joining and suggested incorporating mechanical bird melodies into the cat mural. Mei agreed to collaborate on this idea after completing the community event.",

Later that night, Leo had an encounter with Peter at the train station around 11:00 PM where they discussed the growing community spirit around their project. They decided to have a tea party under the old oak tree, with mechanical birds serenading them and inviting Andy with his sketches and Caroline for her contributions to the bird melodies. Later, Leo spoke to Noor at the gym around 12:00 AM, where they discussed Leo's encounter with Caroline at town hall who invited him to a hospital meeting where he could play a healing melody. They expressed their excitement about the progress of their collaboration and agreed to bring snacks for everyone involved in the project.",
