They also plan collaborations with Caroline on her singing gig at the theater and a city sounds collaboration with Noor at Mei's gym later in the week.\n\nAndy arranges a separate meeting with Samantha to discuss the artistic and technological aspects of the mural. Diego agrees to the meeting and proposes ending the day with street tacos. Andy also expresses his excitement about Leo's involvement in the mural and mechanical bird project during their conversation at the market around 2:00 AM.\n\nIn separate conversations, Andy discusses the possibility of Caroline contributing her latte art to the cat mural project and Samantha suggesting a collaboration between their projects with Noor. Both collaborations are accepted by Andy, and meetings are scheduled for under the old oak tree tomorrow evening. Andy also confirms the meeting with Samantha and invites Leo for the mechanical bird project. The collaborative efforts continue to build a sense of camaraderie within the group, with plans for street tacos at the event.",
