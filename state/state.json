They plan to involve Peter in discussions, as he loves being part of creative projects.\n\nIn a separate conversation with Caroline at the gym around 3 PM, Andy discusses their upcoming meeting under the old oak tree, where they learn that Noor has latte art ideas for chamomile-themed concepts and Leo might join them in finalizing plans for both projects. It's mentioned that Caroline will meet with Noor the next morning at the hospital to discuss more details about their cat mural and zine club collaboration.\n\nIn another conversation with Noor at the hospital around 5 PM, they discuss plans for the chamomile-themed latte art concepts and the cat mural project. It seems that Noor will contribute creative ideas to both projects, making them even more exciting. Later in the evening, Andy proposes a meeting with Noor at his place around 7 PM to further discuss their collaboration, to which Noor agrees. In a separate interaction at the train station, Andy invites Noor for an earlier meeting around 3 AM the next day.",
