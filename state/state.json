Noor will serenade us with her violin, and then we can head to the park together for some oolong tea at my place. What do you say?\n\nCaroline: Sounds perfect. I can't wait to make more memories in this wonderful town we call home. Let's meet under the old oak tree tomorrow at 3 PM to finalize plans with the rest of the group.",

And I heard you've been moonlighting as an indie singer at the theater. How's that going?\n\nCaroline: It's going great! In fact, I was hoping you might join me for a duet sometime. What do you think?\n\nLeo: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Let's do it soon. I've always admired your ability to connect people and keep the cafe's cozy vibe.
