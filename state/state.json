Diego brings up Caroline's idea for a yoga session at the garden, which Peter supports, as he believes it will help them all stay loose while working on the mural.\n\nPeter then talks to Andy at a restaurant around 11:00 AM. They discuss plans for the mural project and a quadruple date at Caroline's Cafe after their meeting tomorrow. Peter suggests incorporating yoga ideas into the mural and brings up Noor's idea about a squirrel-friendly tree. Andy is open to these suggestions, and they both agree to coordinate well for tomorrow and bring snacks and water for everyone. They also discuss involving Noor's students in painting sunflowers for the mural. Peter and Mei later have a conversation at the theater where they plan to meet with Caroline, Diego, and Samantha the next morning to further discuss the mural project and incorporate yoga fusion ideas into it.\n\nLater in the day, Peter talks to Noor at the gym around 7:00 PM.
