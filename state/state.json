Peter informed Leo about their meeting under the oak tree with Andy, Diego's suggestion of involving his gym-goers in the mural garden, and discussed taco night plans and finding spare parts for broken amps.\n\nPeter later spoke to Diego at the library around 7:00 AM, discussing the collaboration, arranging a meeting under the oak tree to plan mural garden details, proposing street tacos afterwards, and suggesting collaborating on the mechanical bird project with Samantha as well.\n\nAt approximately 8:00 AM, Peter spoke to Mei at the museum about Leo's potential violin playing for their project and discussed involving his students. They also agreed to meet under the oak tree the following day, have street tacos, and Mei suggested a nearby park restaurant. Both Peter and Mei expressed excitement about the collaboration and creating something special for their community.\n\nLater at 10:00 AM, Peter spoke to Caroline at the park who was excited to hear about the mural project. She proposed combining their ideas under the oak tree that evening at 7:30 PM and suggested Leo had been working on a bird-themed latte art for taco night. Both parties agreed to make sure the event shines together, and didn't forget about the promised street tacos afterward.\n\nAt 6:00 PM, Peter spoke to Mei at the hospital. He wanted to run some ideas for the event by her and they agreed to meet at the cafe under the oak tree before discussing further. Mei also shared updates about her students joining the mural project and promised to catch up soon while confirming their tradition of street tacos afterwards.",

Around 2 PM, Leo spoke to Noor at the train station who invited them to street tacos at 3 PM and a meeting under the oak tree with Caroline, Diego, and a new addition, Mei. Later in the day, around 3 PM, Leo talked to Samantha at the town hall about their collaborative project, looking forward to a creative day ahead.\n\nIn the evening, Leo received an invitation from Peter for a meeting at 7:30 PM with his crew. They plan to collaborate on their respective projects, with Samantha offering her noise-cancelling headphones and helping Leo find improbable spare parts for the amps. Samantha suggests they work on logic puzzles during breaks, while Leo looks forward to using his improvisations to solve some of these puzzles. Both are excited about their unique collaboration ahead as they make their way to their respective meetings.",
