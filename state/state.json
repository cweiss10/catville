They also talk further about details such as inviting Noor's robotics club to provide food for stray cats during their community event.\n\nLater in the day, Andy has another conversation with Samantha at the train station around 5:00 PM, discussing various details further and confirming the meeting tomorrow at the library. They also discuss Leo's intention to join them with his intriguing pattern work, which could add a great touch to their mural.\n\nAround 9:00 PM, Andy talks to Samantha at the town hall about the mural project. Andy expresses excitement about how the rhythm algorithms will engage visitors and mentions feeding Stray-13 before heading to Caroline's. Samantha agrees to help with this and suggests taking a back alley route for less traffic noise.\n\nIn the evening, Andy talks to Leo at the gym around 10:00 PM about incorporating a mechanical bird into their cat mural project. They plan to discuss it further over chamomile tea at Caroline's, inviting Mei and Noor as well. Additionally, Luna from the zine club is interested in joining them, looking forward to creating something unique together.",

The meeting is scheduled for 10 AM.\n\nLater in the day, Diego proposes a meeting with Noor at Caroline's Café that night to discuss collaborative efforts on their respective projects, involving the robotics club's help with sound systems and noise-cancelling headphones. Noor agrees and also invites Diego to join her, Mei, Samantha, and Leo under the old oak tree next weekend to share updates about their projects.
