On the same day at around 10:00 AM, Caroline talks to Diego at the gym about the collaboration, who shares his mechanical bird ideas and promises spicy street tacos.

In response, Peter shares his conversation with Noor and proposes an inclusive group activity after the meeting – either a walk or quick workout.\n\nAt around 4:00 AM, Peter talks to Mei at the town hall. He suggests incorporating her robotics for mechanical birds into their project. Mei agrees to discuss further over chamomile latte and proposes a workout session together, reminding Peter about his promise of chamomile seeds for Samantha's garden.\n\nLater that night around 5:00 AM, Peter talks to Caroline at the train station. She is excited about the idea of mechanical birds in their mural project and suggests working on it together at the oak tree tomorrow. Caroline reminds Peter about his spicy taco promise for Diego's date tonight, to which Peter agrees. The meeting this weekend will be memorable.",
