Andy suggests involving Caroline's students for a yoga session before they start on the sunrise scene of the mural. Andy offers Noor's treats for stray animals after the yoga session and is concerned about Leo's squirrel tunes disrupting the session, to which Caroline reassures him with the promise of noise-cancelling headphones. They agree to have a brainstorming session at the park in the morning and Caroline invites Leo for an impromptu performance beforehand. Both parties express enthusiasm about the project and the upcoming events. Andy is reminded to bring his thermos of tea to their meeting, while Caroline communicates with Leo about the plans for the mural project and performance.",

He thought it was a great idea!\n\nMei: That's fantastic news! Let's make sure we coordinate schedules and involve both our students as well. We could even set up a regular feeding schedule for the stray cats behind the café.\n\nNoor: I completely agree!

He thought it was a great idea!\n\nMei: That's fantastic news! Let's make sure we coordinate schedules and involve both our students as well. We could even set up a regular feeding schedule for the stray cats behind the café.\n\nNoor: I completely agree! And speaking of which, Diego has an interesting idea – incorporating his squirrel song into my robotics project. What do you think?\n\nMei: That's intriguing!

At 9:00 PM, Leo talks to Peter again at a train station where they discuss Peter's comment on Leo's bird act and potential further collaboration. They also talk about Samantha's plans for stray animals behind the cafe, and Leo proposes inviting her to their duet performance at the park the next day, which Peter agrees to enthusiastically. At 5:00 AM, Leo talks to Caroline at school, who appreciated his violin serenade from the previous night's double date. They discuss Caroline's yoga plans with Diego and her cat nook project.
