They discussed a community event collaboration, plans for chamomile lattes in the mural garden, and Mei's excitement about integrating mechanical birds into their cat mural.\n\nLater, around 6:00 AM, Andy talked to Mei at the market, who suggested meeting under the old oak tree the following day at 5 PM to discuss the project further. They agreed to bring chamomile lattes and seeds for Caroline's garden, aiming to make it a special evening.\n\nAt 9:00 AM, Andy spoke to Diego at the hospital, where Diego expressed interest in the collaboration, mentioning he'd be fine for the joint venture. They discussed the potential incorporation of mechanical birds into the mural and the possibility of a city sounds project.\n\nAround 10:00 AM, Andy met up with Diego at the park, inviting him to join their cat mural collaboration under the old oak tree that evening. Diego agreed, bringing seedlings for the community garden and looking forward to the discussion, tea, tacos, and possible duet.",

Caroline agrees, and they plan for Peter to keep the cozy vibe intact. During their conversation, Peter mentions his collaboration with Mei on the mural project and expresses interest in joining forces with Andy's cat mural project. Caroline suggests this as a potential fit and promises to bring tea for the gathering at the oak tree that night.
