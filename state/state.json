She informs him about the progress of their mural project, having run into Caroline at the town hall earlier in the day. In response, Peter shares his conversation with Noor and proposes an inclusive group activity after the meeting – either a walk or quick workout.\n\nAt around 4:00 AM, Peter talks to Mei at the town hall. He suggests incorporating her robotics for mechanical birds into their project. Mei agrees to discuss further over chamomile latte and proposes a workout session together, reminding Peter about his promise of chamomile seeds for Samantha's garden.
