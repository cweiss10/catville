Caroline agrees, offers a free latte, and reminds Andy of her rehearsal later that night.\n\nAndy then arranges a conversation with Noor at the park around 11:00 PM, who plans noise-cancelling headphones for their practice sessions with Leo at the gym. They talk about blending Noor's chamomile seeds with Leo and Mei's design elements, and Caroline shares her latest latte art inspired by chamomile.\n\nLater, around 1:00 AM, the human talks to Andy at home where he expresses gratitude for using Caroline's café for rehearsals, suggesting it is more than just a café but a connection hub for the community. He also mentions preparing street tacos for their gathering and promises to discuss suggestions with the team. Caroline reminds him of her upcoming meeting under the old oak tree and wishes him goodnight.",

They share excitement, contribute materials, plan for focus aids, and express appreciation for strengthening town connections. Later that evening, around 8:00 PM, Mei talks to Noor at a restaurant, suggesting incorporating elements of their town's architecture into latte art designs for their project. Noor agrees to further discuss the idea with everyone during their meeting under the oak tree, and Mei gifts seeds for the garden.\n\nThe next day, at 6:00 AM, Mei talks to Leo at the gym about joining their cat mural project. Leo expresses excitement and brings his violin for bird melodies during their collaboration, while Mei reminds him of the oak tree meeting time and suggests bringing headphones for practice sessions with Diego.",
