I also heard Andy's excited about our plans and suggested a collaboration with Mei for the mural. How about we finalize everything tomorrow at that coffee place you love?\n\nNoor: That sounds great! Let's grab some snacks too, just like today. And don't forget to bring your sketchbook. I can't wait to see what Andy contributes to the project!\n\nPeter: You got it! Looking forward to it. Oh, and Diego offered some cat seeds for the mural – they plan to meet up soon. We should all have a quadruple date in the park sometime too, right?\n\nNoor: That sounds like a fantastic idea!
