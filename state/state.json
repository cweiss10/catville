Andy also spoke with Caroline at school around 3:00 PM, offering her a tea from his thermos in anticipation of the old oak tree meeting tomorrow.\n\nCaroline, meanwhile, talked to Mei at the market around 4:00 PM about the zine club she's working on. Mei shared that they have a fun logic puzzle planned for their students, which ties in perfectly with their cat mural theme. Caroline was invited by Mei to join them under the old oak tree tomorrow at 4 PM and suggested they keep up their tradition of grabbing a chamomile latte beforehand. They also plan to bring noise-cancelling headphones. Mei agreed to meet at 3 PM and have that latte first thing. Both women look forward to their collaborative projects, recalling fondly their previous community center projects.",

I was just discussing this with Andy at the hospital today, and he suggested we all gather under that old oak tree. How about a tea party tomorrow at 3 PM?\"\n\nMei: \"I'd love that! I can bring some chamomile from the café and have Peter record city sounds as a backdrop. And perhaps we could involve your kitten in our zine club meeting tonight?\"\n\nLeo: \"That's perfect! I'll grab my violin, some chamomile lattes, and bring my kitty along. See you under the oak tree tomorrow.\"",

By the way, I was also thinking we could bring treats for the stray cats during our pre-meeting tea party under the oak tree tomorrow. What do you think?\n\nAndy: I think it's perfect!
