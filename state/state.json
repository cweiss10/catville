And speaking of Leo, don't forget to ask him about joining our rehearsal on Saturday. I'll bring seeds for the community garden and some treats from Caroline's café for the strays.\n\nNoor: Perfect! Let's also invite Diego and discuss how we can incorporate him into our project. I've got some sunrise seeds for the gazebo trees, and I'd love to participate in the bird duet rehearsal with you guys.\n\nMei: It's going to be a fantastic collaboration! Excited to see what we can create together for our town.\n\nNoor: Me too, Mei. Let's make sure we have plenty of snacks for the students who might need them. We're all in this to strengthen our community.",
