The conversation continued after Andy visited Leo at the hospital around 4:00 AM, and with Peter at the museum around 7:00 AM.\n\nLater, Leo spoke to Caroline at the train station around 11:00 AM about the progress of the mural project, sharing his new tunes for the meeting under the old oak tree, which included Samantha's participation and Peter's ideas for the watering system. Both were excited about the collaboration, looking forward to their upcoming meeting with fresh cups of tea, a double date at Main Street Tacos this weekend, and discussing the project further with Noor around 12:00 PM who praised its potential and suggested a double date and bringing cat food for Stray-13.",
