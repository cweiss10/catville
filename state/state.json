Let's make it happen, and don't forget our bird duet practice in the morning. I think we're really starting to harmonize.\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect! And yes, I'll be there for your music as well as the cat mural collaboration. It's great to work with you, Caroline.\n\nCaroline: The feeling is mutual, Noor.

Diego mentions Caroline's excitement about the project and suggests feeding stray cats behind Andy's cafÃ© before their meeting.

She expresses her enthusiasm for the cat mural project and compliments Leo on his squirrel latte art ideas. Leo proposes a bird duet piece called 'Canon in D' and invites Noor and Andy to hear it at the park tomorrow.
