After additional conversations with Samantha at 12:00 PM, 8:00 PM, and 9:00 PM, Andy invites her for a meeting at her place tonight at 8:00 PM to discuss the cat mural project further, bringing snacks for stray cats. He also mentions a squirrel latte art contest at the community garden he's keen on participating in.\n\nSamantha offers to show Andy some interactive elements she coded for their cat mural project. Andy talks to Peter at the library around 10:00 PM about exchanging cat treats and plans a meeting with him at Main Street Tacos on Wednesday at 3 PM to brainstorm ideas for their bird duet before rehearsal. Peter mentions having a meeting with Mei there at 4 PM to discuss the interactive tree idea for their project, and Andy offers Peter some noise-cancelling headphones he received from Caroline.\n\nDuring a conversation with Peter at the library around 12:00 AM, Andy suggests they grab coffee beforehand and sketch out ideas for their bird duet, proposing to incorporate Diego's gym routines into the tree design. Peter agrees to discuss it further during their meeting on Wednesday afternoon at Main Street Tacos. Both are excited about the collaborations and believe the town will benefit from their projects.\n\nAndy talks to Leo at school around 2:00 AM, reminding him of their meeting tonight under the gazebo. They agree to pick up some cat food from Diego beforehand, as the stray cats are a big part of their community. Andy expresses his excitement for the upcoming meetings and events with his collaborators, hoping to make it a memorable night.",
