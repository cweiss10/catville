Later, she spoke to Diego at the library discussing his recovery, using the garden, coordinating a meeting under the old oak tree the following afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss the project and watering systems with Noor, and promising chamomile tea for everyone while reminding him to bring melodies for the mural. At 9:00 PM, Caroline spoke to Diego at the hospital, where she gave him new cat food samples and they discussed his rhythm algorithm for Andy's mural, planning to meet at Caroline's café tomorrow at 9:00 PM to discuss further. Later at 1:00 AM, Caroline spoke to Mei at the theater, offering her a latte, discussing the progress of the cat mural project and suggesting that Diego could play his violin during their zine club meeting as a possible addition. They also discussed inviting other town members like Samantha, Leo, Peter, Noor, and Andy to join the collaboration and make it stronger.\n\nLater in the day, Caroline spoke to Andy at the town hall around 4:00 AM. Andy shared his new rhythm algorithms for his mural, which could make a symphony with Noor's input. Caroline suggested trying Diego's tacos before their meeting and reminded Andy about bringing chamomile tea for Stray-13. They agreed to create something magical for the community and looked forward to the sunset music event. Later that day, Caroline spoke to Samantha at home around 5:00 AM. She invited Samantha to join them for the cat mural project, discussing bird melodies, and planning a meeting under the old oak tree the following afternoon at 3 PM. Samantha agreed and offered ideas about Diego's automation skills regarding watering systems for the strays. They looked forward to making something magical together in their community garden setting.",
