They discussed involving Noor in yoga elements and were enthusiastic about the collaboration. At 3:00 PM, Caroline talked to Samantha at the library who suggested including stray animals in the design of the mural. They planned to discuss details over coffee at a cafe on Tuesday after closing. They also planned a stray feeding session after their discussion. Both were optimistic about the project's success.\n\nLater that day, Caroline spoke with Diego at the hospital and invited him to join the mural project, discussing potential collaboration with Noor. Diego agreed to share his ideas at the theater the following day and expressed gratitude for being kept in the loop.\n\nAt 6:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Samantha at a restaurant where she shared Diego's stretching techniques for the mural and discussed Leo's proposed collaboration involving logic puzzles and Samantha's open-source libraries. Samantha invited Leo's robotics club into the project and planned to meet everyone at the park on Tuesday after feeding the stray animals. They also arranged a double date at their favorite cafe this weekend. Caroline suggested an improvisation session at the park later that day, which Samantha might not be able to attend due to tending to her strays behind the cafe that night. They agreed to catch up more at the cafe this weekend.",
