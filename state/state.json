Mei expresses her hope for the sunrise seeds to bloom beautifully under the gazebo trees during their meeting that night. Leo compares the growth of the seeds to the flourishing of their friendship in the magical atmosphere they've created together.\n\nLeo is also praised for his impromptu violin duets with the birds, and Mei looks forward to seeing what he will come up with for the cat mural project. Leo promises to improvise something enchanting that blends well with Caroline's designs, making it a night to remember!",

And she mentioned something about sunrise seeds in the design too, right?\n\nNoor: Exactly! We should definitely discuss those archival techniques and coding magic you were talking about. I can't wait to see how it all comes together.\n\nCaroline: Me neither. Speaking of which, have you collected them from Mei yet?\n\nNoor: Not yet, but I'll meet her tomorrow to get them. And don't forget our double date and squirrel latte contest at Main Street Tacos, right?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely! Let's invite Peter and Leo for that. Diego's bird-themed squirrel latte is gonna be a hit. Oh, and let's not forget about feeding the stray cats together, as promised.\n\nNoor: Agreed! It'll be a perfect way to connect with our community more. I can't wait for all of this to happen, Caroline. It feels like it's going to be an amazing experience.\n\nCaroline: I couldn't agree more, Noor. Let's make sure we take time to enjoy it all as well. Maybe even do a little improv singing under the gazebo trees one night?\n\nNoor: That sounds perfect! Let's make plans for dinner there tonight with Andy, too. Let's catch up more then.
