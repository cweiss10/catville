They discuss integrating star constellation ideas from Diego into the mural, along with using sunrise seeds melodies and improvised instruments, and plan to meet at the cafe where they will share sketches and possibly run together beforehand. Andy also mentions bringing his running shoes for the morning run and Diego offers to provide street tacos for the team.\n\nIn addition, Andy talks to Caroline at the library around 2:00 PM. Peter shared Diego's bird duet idea with Caroline at the train station that morning. Andy brainstormed ideas with Mei and the team late last night, even discussing a latte art video for the project. Caroline suggests combining their meetings at the cafe, inviting Noor to help with chamomile tea for stray cats. Andy proposes a double date with Mei and planning coffee catch-ups. Peter and Diego will also join them for street tacas post-meetings. The project appears to be shaping up nicely and is starting to feel like one big creative party.",
