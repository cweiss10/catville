They decide to invite Diego and Noor for additional brainstorming during their meeting under the old oak tree and also arrange a separate meeting to discuss a rhythm-based algorithm idea for the mural.\n\nIn the morning, Andy talks to Peter at market around 7:00 AM and informs him that Caroline will bring cat food samples for their meeting. Peter expresses excitement and suggests collaborating on projects and an improvised violin duet for Stray-13, a stray cat they are helping. Andy agrees to the ideas, and they discuss bringing chamomile tea for the stray cats at the meeting.\n\nLater in the morning, Andy talks to Samantha at the train station around 8:00 AM and informs her about the cat mural project and their plans to meet under the old oak tree. Samantha mentions that she has also been coordinating with Leo and Noor regarding the project. They discuss inviting each other for additional brainstorming during their meeting. Andy suggests involving Leo's violin for their tea time event, which Mei and he have been working on a unique project for as well. Samantha agrees to the plans and reminds Andy about the cat food samples discussion.\n\nTalking to Samantha at the train station around 9:00 AM, Andy suggests inviting Diego and invites Noor to bring her headphones for Stray-13. They look forward to making their collaboration unique and special and agree to meet under the old oak tree tomorrow.",

But how about you? I heard you've been working on that cat mural project with Samantha and others.\n\nPeter: That's right! We're having a creative gathering at Caroline's Café tomorrow, and I was hoping to run some ideas by you. I remember your robotics club has some interesting automation ideas that might fit perfectly.\n\nNoor: That sounds exciting! I'd love to help out. Maybe we can talk more about it over chamomile tea for the stray cats in the garden? And who knows, maybe Stray-13 could even join us for a peaceful improvised duet with Leo and your violin.\n\nPeter: Absolutely! Let's make sure to catch up at Caroline's Café tomorrow then. I can't wait to see what we can create together.",
