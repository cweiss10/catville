And remember, the tea in your thermos might be just what you need to spark that creativity. Plus, I heard Samantha was impressed with your logic puzzles.

We should make it official with a potluck under the old oak tree where we first started discussing this. How does that sound to you?\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect to me, Caroline!

Your Saturday zine club students might enjoy collaborating on the chamomile lattes for our potluck under the oak tree. Hope you don't mind!\"\n\nMei: \"Not at all! I think they'd love that. And speaking of chamomile, remember we were going to have tea tomorrow? I brought the seeds as promised.\"\n\nNoor: \"Oh, great! I'll make sure to bring some snacks for the students too. Let's make it a successful event, just like our town hall advocacy for better lab equipment.\"",

Later, at the gym around 1 PM, Samantha shares her inspiration for Mei's mural project, drawing parallels to Leo's music. Leo suggests that their chamomile blend would pair well with his city night sounds theme. Samantha proposes meeting at the community garden in the evening to further discuss their collaborative project, and they both express anticipation for what they will create together.",
