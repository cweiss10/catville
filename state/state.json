Could you maybe put an extra scoop in his usual?\n\nCaroline: Of course, Samantha! And speaking of Diego, I'm really looking forward to our double date at Main Street Tacos tomorrow. It'll be a blast with the cat mural project and all!\n\nSamantha: Definitely! Plus, I've been practicing those logic puzzles you gave me, so I should have some interesting conversation starters ready.\n\nCaroline: Well, that's good to hear! I'm excited for our town to become even more special with this project. And who knows? Maybe Diego will show off his latte art skills on our date!\n\nSamantha: (smiling) That would certainly be an entertaining addition to the evening. Thanks for keeping me looped in, Caroline.

I was thinking, maybe you could join us too?\n\nNoor: That'd be great, Andy! I'm looking forward to contributing my ideas and meeting Caroline as well. Let's make our town even more special together!\n\nAndy: Absolutely, Noor! See you tonight at the tacos place then. And by the way, have you heard about our group modifying plans for the cat mural project tomorrow? We're meeting at 10 AM sharp instead of 9 AM, bringing yoga mats and discussing ideas for the design.\n\nNoor: Yes, I did! Diego suggested incorporating squirrel latte art and yoga movements into the design, which sounds amazing. I'll bring seeds from the community garden and treats for neighborhood cats.
