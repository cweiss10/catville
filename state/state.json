He also mentioned he had spoken with Samantha about musical elements for their gathering under the old oak tree and suggested involving Noor's robotics club in that aspect.\n\nMei then spoke to Andy at the museum around 11:00 AM, who shared some exciting ideas for rhythm algorithms and a violin performance for the mural project. Mei discussed incorporating Diego's street art into the design and suggested involving kids from the community center. They agreed to meet at Caroline's Cafe tomorrow at 10 AM to discuss these ideas.\n\nMei also spoke to Andy at museum around 5:00 PM, who proposed a gathering at his place tomorrow at 2 PM to further discuss their mural project details over tea and showcase latte art ideas. Mei agreed and suggested meeting earlier at the park with chamomile tea for the stray cats. They also decided to have Samantha's tacos beforehand, and Andy offered to gather everyone at his place.",
