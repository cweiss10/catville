Caroline proposes this meeting after their practice session and suggests bringing tea and having Diego share his street tacos. Peter agrees to maintain the cozy vibe of their collaboration.\n\nLater in the day, Caroline talks to Andy at school around 1:00 PM about their community projects. Andy mentions his cat mural collaboration with Noor and proposes incorporating Diego's city sounds into their mechanical designs for a unique touch. They plan to grab chamomile lattes at the theater tomorrow before practicing under the old oak tree, and even ask Noor's choir to perform an improvised duet near Andy's cat mural garden. Caroline agrees to this idea, expressing excitement about the collaborative projects blooming in their community event.",

Second, at a restaurant around 10:00 AM, Peter invited Noor for a brainstorming session under the oak tree that evening about their mural garden and kinetic plant sculptures, with plans to bring mint tea. Third, at the library around 12:00 PM, Samantha suggested an earlier brainstorming session today with Noor regarding the mechanical bird design, and they agreed to meet at 2 PM after grabbing mint tea from a cafe. Additionally, Noor mentioned she might bring spicy tacos.\n\nFourth, at the museum around 1:00 PM, Mei expressed excitement about incorporating Diego's city sounds in her cat mural and suggested discussing bird designs under the oak tree during the evening brainstorming session. Noor then shared that Andy is on board with meeting up tonight to work on mechanical birds, proposing they invite Caroline and some students from the community center too. Mei agreed, suggesting they bring chamomile tea, while Caroline suggested sharing mint tea as well. Peter was invited to help plan a musical number for their projects, and Andy offered street tacos after school. The events aim to strengthen the creative community and involve everyone.",
