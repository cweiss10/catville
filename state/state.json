Yes, I did. Mei told me Samantha is on board with having him join us. Excited for some latte art in our mural, aren't you? And speaking of which, Andy brought sunrise seeds for Stray-13. You should try them at dinner as a thank you for his help with the amp design.\n\nDiego: That sounds like a great idea! I can't wait to see how the mural turns out. By the way, Caroline is eager to join us and bring her ideas for Leo's amp under the old oak tree tomorrow. How does that sound?\n\nNoor: That's wonderful news! Caroline's creativity will really enhance our project. And I heard Peter suggested a rehearsal for Leo under the oak tree before our meeting. He wanted to make it special and bring everyone closer together. How about we make it a double date at Main Street Tacos?\n\nDiego: That sounds like a perfect plan, Noor. Let's invite Peter too. I think he'd enjoy contributing his artistic touch to the mural. See you around 7 PM!",

Andy agrees and offers to bring chamomile tea for Diego's cats too. They also discuss meeting up with Diego for an early-morning run the next day, as well as a meeting with Samantha under the old oak tree that night to further discuss the mural details.
