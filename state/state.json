They also discussed using Mei's noise-cancelling headphones for their mural project under the oak tree.\n\nLater in the evening, around 9:00 PM, Mei talked to Noor at home and shared that Diego is recovering well thanks to Noor's advice and Andy's stretches. They discussed Leo potentially setting up for their improvised symphony. Noor shared that she received sunrise seeds from Peter that morning for the cat mural design and they plan to discuss it with Mei, Andy, and Diego over lunch today.\n\nBoth Mei and Noor have labeled notes about their ideas in their bags and are looking forward to a productive meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow. They plan to make sure everyone feels included and contributes their unique talents to the project, similar to the community garden they both care for.\n\nIn a later conversation at the train station, Mei and Diego discuss how Mei's sunrise seeds ideas are progressing, with Leo suggesting incorporating star constellations into the nighttime theme for the cat mural. Diego expresses excitement about discussing this further with Leo and thanks Mei for keeping him in the loop.",
