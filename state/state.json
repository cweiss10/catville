I've been meaning to feed them again.\n\nSamantha: Yes, I've noticed a few recently. Let's make sure we take care of them while we're there.

They discuss a squirrel design for the cat mural project and agree to impress Caroline with their A-game.\n\nLater that night, around 1:00 AM, the human talks to Mei at a restaurant. Mei shares that she will help with the cat mural project in the morning at the garden and suggests brainstorming for musical collaborations at Main Street Tacos during the week. They also discuss a fitness demonstration collaboration at the museum next week. Leo promises to work on something special for the community celebration.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, the human talks to Andy at a town hall, where they discuss their mural project and collaborative efforts with Noor, Peter, and Diego.

Your suggestion about the squirrel-friendly trees is spot on. Speaking of which, have you seen that old oak tree near the gazebo? I think it'd make a perfect addition to our project.\n\nPeter: That sounds wonderful, Leo! I'll definitely check it out this morning and can't wait to see your design sketches later today.
