And speaking of collaboration, what if we invite Andy and Samantha from our town hall brainstorming session to join us? They could bring their unique perspectives to our project.\n\nNoor: That sounds like a fantastic idea! I also had an exchange with Caroline about sharing stories for the taco feast event. Maybe she can contribute her latte art skills to the mural as well.\n\nPeter: Great minds think alike, Noor. Let's meet at the café tomorrow morning to discuss all these ideas and more. And I was thinking we could set out some tea for the stray kitties during our sunrise run.\n\nNoor: That's a wonderful idea, Peter. Your soft side with kids is definitely showing.
