They also plan to catch up over coffee later in the day and reminisce about their old busking days in the park. At 6:00 PM, Caroline talks to Samantha at the gym about their joint project. They discuss Noor's design, Leo's contribution from his club, and a surprise for the stray cats behind the cafe during the event. They also plan to catch up more about the interactive tree project tomorrow at Main Street Tacos, with Mei joining them as well.",

Diego proposed a meeting over coffee tomorrow to discuss ideas for their mural project and Samantha's tree project, as well as robotics aspects.

They also plan to talk about the squirrel mural event planning as well. Peter agrees to bring Noor along so she can share her robotics expertise, and they look forward to their meeting at the gazebo trees tonight.\n\nLater in the day, Leo talks to Caroline at home who invites him to join a performance by Diego tonight, sharing an extra ticket. Leo accepts the invitation, looking forward to hearing Caroline's new songs and potentially sneaking in a jam session afterwards.
