They also discuss a new stretch routine for their performance under the old oak tree.\n\nIn the evening, Caroline talks to Samantha at a restaurant, who expresses excitement about the cat mural project. Later in the night, Caroline converses with Diego again at the town hall.\n\nLater still, Caroline talks to Peter at the market around 12:00 AM. They discuss plans for the cat mural project and Peter shares that they have been discussing a musical collaboration idea with Noor. Caroline suggests gathering everyone soon to coordinate their bird contributions and adds that she has been brainstorming ideas with Mei. They agree to make it a group workout session after the meeting, with Leo possibly serenading her latte art during the work session. Caroline promises to spread the word at the cafe. The group looks forward to everyone's collaboration on the cat mural project.",
