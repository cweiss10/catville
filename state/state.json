Peter suggested that instead of Main Street Tacos on Thursday, they could have dinner at El Charro at 6 PM, which Diego agreed to.

They also agreed to cover topics related to the mural project during their discussion. Caroline contacted Diego around 4:00 AM at the train_station, discussing the upcoming yoga session and confirming Leo's participation with his violin.
