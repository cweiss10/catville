Later, Caroline talked to Noor at the theater around 12:00 AM, discussing progress on puzzles for the cat mural project with Noor's robotics club. They finalized plans to meet at Main Street Tacos this Saturday and decided to involve Peter's ideas, collaborate effectively, and use headphones during discussions to focus better. Caroline will bring seeds from Andy's garden and food for stray cats. At 1:00 AM, Caroline spoke with Mei at the theater, suggesting a pre-dinner meeting at the park this weekend to brainstorm with everyone involved in their projects, including Andy and possibly others.

We've got some exciting ideas brewing for the squirrel latte art and bird improvisation. Have you talked to Mei and Diego about our part in the park community project tonight?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! We're all set to bring fish tacos for the neighborhood cats. I was thinking we could make it a mini neighborhood get-together and share some ideas on how to strengthen our community through small rituals like this cat mural project.
