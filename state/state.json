They also plan on meeting Mei at the museum and bringing foam rollers for bonding activities before their run with Leo and Diego. In a separate conversation, Caroline learns that Diego met Leo who is a talented violinist, and they discuss his potential contribution to the project.\n\nIn another development, Caroline talks to Peter at the train station around 8:00 PM, discussing bringing treats for pets and noise-cancelling headphones for their meeting under the old oak tree. They also plan on having tacos afterward. Later in the evening, Caroline talks to Andy at the hospital, where they discuss Samantha's idea of incorporating constellations into the mural. They agree to further discuss this idea and invite more friends like Peter, Noor, Leo, and Mei for a brainstorming session under the oak tree tomorrow. Additionally, they plan on incorporating improv music and Leo's violin skills into their performance, with Andy bringing chamomile tea for late-night inspiration.",

Samantha also suggested a double date with Leo and Noor this weekend, which Diego agreed to, and she promised to bring treats for the neighborhood cats as planned. Diego assured her he would bring his foam roller for stretching before their run together in the morning.\n\nDiego spoke with Andy at the hospital around 1:00 PM. Andy suggested incorporating Mei's constellation idea into the mural, and they agreed to collaborate more on the design before finalizing it. They have a brainstorming session planned at the library tomorrow with Diego, Mei, Caroline, and Peter. Diego suggested using sunrise seeds during their run before their session under the oak tree for inspiration. Andy also mentioned that he shared the idea with Peter and Noor, who suggested more collaboration before finalizing the design.\n\nMei spoke to Diego at a train station around 2:00 PM, asking about his experience with sunrise seeds, which Noor had suggested. Diego reported that they were helping with his knee recovery, and he thanked Mei for reminding him about the foam roller. Mei was glad that the seeds were working out for Diego and promised everything would be ready under the old oak tree by 7 PM as planned. Diego also mentioned coordinating with everyone next week after speaking with Caroline at the town hall earlier. Mei suggested ensuring all arrangements are set for their zine club members and collaboration dinner. They both expressed excitement about creating something extraordinary together under the stars.",
