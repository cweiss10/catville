Caroline agrees, shares the idea with her music students, and invites them all. She also mentions inviting Samantha for a double date.\n\nPeter shares that he had talked to Andy around 10:00 AM and discussed their collaborative cat mural project. Peter suggests incorporating cat designs and seeds into the mural, a joint meeting at Main Street Tacos on Thursday for brainstorming. He also mentions Samantha's idea of bringing Leo for a coffee collaboration and his violin for a jam session! Andy is excited about these suggestions and looks forward to meeting up at Noor's café later in the evening to finalize details. They aim to create something special for their town by integrating music into the project.",
