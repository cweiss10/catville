I saw Caroline earlier too; we discussed our mural project plans and she reminded me to stretch before our run tomorrow.\n\nNoor: That sounds great! Speaking of which, have you tried sunrise seeds in your stretches? Mei suggested it might help with recovery for your knee.\n\nDiego: Interesting! I'll definitely give that a try. And how about that double date under the old oak tree? Caroline brought up some chamomile tea as well.\n\nNoor: Yes, Samantha mentioned it too. Looking forward to that.

They discussed collaborating on a unique project for the cat mural, and agreed to meet at a café the next day for discussion over chamomile tea for stray cats. Leo suggested incorporating his improvised instruments into Andy's mural plans.\n\nAt 8:00 AM, Samantha met with Leo in the park where she shared that she had found an old violin for their project. They expressed excitement about the musical sunrise event and the cat mural collaboration. Leo invited her to a café meeting the next day and looked forward to seeing how everything unfolded.",
