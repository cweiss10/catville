They are both excited about the unique community event at the library and appreciate each other's contributions to the project.\n\nLater in the day, Andy talks to Samantha at the museum about the project. She agrees that it will be special for the kids, and having Noor's club involved will only make it better. Andy wonders about Diego's thoughts on their rhythm algorithms and watering systems, and Samantha schedules a meeting under the old oak tree to discuss it with him. Tacos are also involved in this meeting. Andy feels that this project will bring the town together for something special.",

Noor and Samantha have also been discussing this idea separately. They plan to meet at Caroline's Café the next day to further discuss these plans and bring chamomile tea. In addition to their regular gathering under the old oak tree, they will introduce Stray-13 and Luna to a surprise that Noor has planned for an anticipated community event. The group agrees to come energized and ready to work.",
