We could use them to create a 'sunrise in the forest' theme.\n\nNoor: That's brilliant, Diego! With Caroline's bird inspiration and your stretching tips, I think it has a chance of winning. Let's make sure to discuss it with Peter at the market later.\n\nDiego: Definitely. And how about we grab some street tacos before we get started? I know just the place.\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect!

They also confirmed Leo's participation in the squirrel latte contest and agreed that his violin would be a perfect addition to the friendly competition.\n\nIn addition, Leo talked to Samantha at the hospital around 11:00 PM, who informed him about finishing another open-source project and feeding the stray cats as usual. They discussed their plans for the cat mural project and arrangements to meet with Diego and Caroline at Main Street Tacos the next day. Leo expressed his excitement about how his violin melodies would contribute to the project, and they agreed to make music together.",
