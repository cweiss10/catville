Andy appreciciates Caroline's latte art, which he feels is a perfect match for their community event. He proposes involving Caroline's theater group in the tea party under the old oak tree. Caroline accepts the invitation, and they agree to plan a meeting to finalize everything beforehand.\n\nLater, at 10:00 PM, Caroline talks to Samantha at the park. Samantha expresses her excitement about Caroline's latte-art day and the bird design, suggesting that Noor's kitten might make a cute mascot for their event. She invites Peter and Diego to bring tacos, and they agree to involve Leo in the gatherings as well. They plan to catch up more at Andy's tea party the following day.",
