Mei also shared her preparations for a quadruple date, where Leo will perform bird songs on his violin as a duet in the park.\n\nLater, Andy caught up with Caroline at town_hall around 2:00 PM and they discussed their collaboration on the mural, with Andy learning that Caroline has also spoken to Mei about Leo's squirrel tunes. Both are excited about incorporating Leo's music in the mural and look forward to their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation around 3:00 PM, Andy suggests adding yoga before rehearsals for a unique twist in their park performance. Mei agrees, suggesting they discuss more details later that day at the train station. Both are excited about collaborating to create something special for their town.",

In addition, Mei, who Diego talked to at the library around 11:00 PM, proposed grabbing street tacos together at Main Street Tacos on Thursday during their meeting for the mural project. They also discussed a cat-themed concert that Mei is organizing, and how Peter's squirrel tunes might fit in.

Peter mentions Caroline helping Noor on a mural project, suggesting potential collaboration. Both agree to discuss further plans at Main Street Tacos later in the week. Leo informs Peter that he is close to fixing his broken amp.\n\nLater, in a separate conversation with Andy at the gym around 9:00 PM, Andy proposes incorporating squirrel tunes into the cat project at El Charro. Leo agrees and suggests inviting the kids from the community center to collaborate with bird duets. They agree to meet at Main Street Tacos that night to further discuss their plans. Leo also invites Mei, Samantha, and Diego, hoping to create something magical together.\n\nIn another conversation at the museum around 11:00 PM, Andy proposes the cat mural and robotics club performance, while mentioning a collaboration with Noor's group. They discuss the possibility of a regular cat feeding schedule behind Caroline's Café. Noor also mentions a quadruple date next week for creative brainstorming sessions. Exciting times ahead!",
