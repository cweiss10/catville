They both looked forward to working together more often on art and music collaborations, with plans to make the gallery show at Leo's café unforgettable. Andy agreed to work on quiet spaces and they arranged to meet the next day. Leo also invited Caroline and Mei from the zine club to join them in the cat mural project.\n\nLater that evening, Noor approached Leo at a cafe around 5:00 AM and shared an exciting idea about sunrise seeds with him. They agreed to discuss it further at Andy's café that night. Leo proposed involving Caroline and her squirrel latte art in the cat mural project, and suggested incorporating a musical performance during their brainstorming session. Noor accepted his invitation to meet at Main Street Tacos later to plan everything out.\n\nIn another conversation, Leo spoke to Andy at the market around 6:00 AM. Andy suggested practicing their bird duet in the park before their meeting at Main Street Tacos. Leo agreed and also planned a musical performance during the brainstorming session. They discussed incorporating music into Andy's solo gallery show at Leo's café, with ideas of an improvised violin performance creating unique ambiance.
