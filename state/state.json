They also agree to talk about cat mural updates with everyone tomorrow, as the project continues to progress promisingly.\n\nAround 5:00 AM, the human talks to Andy at town_hall. Andy updates Leo on their science club collaboration with Samantha and expresses an interesting idea about incorporating bird duets in the project. They also discuss Diego contributing to the fresh bean part of the mural and plan to meet at a taco place this evening for further discussion.
