Andy presented his progress on the cat design for the mural, suggesting that logic puzzles could be incorporated as hidden elements within it and proposing adding a bird duet to make it interactive for park visitors. They agreed to this idea and suggested meeting up later in the week at Main Street Tacos to further discuss plans, bringing up the possibility of inviting Samantha to join them. They also discussed incorporating Andy's dog Stray-13 into their gatherings, and they decided to keep each other updated as they worked on their respective parts for the projects.\n\nLater at 3:00 PM, Leo talked to Noor at the theater. Noor shared exciting news about the cat mural project, mentioning a collaboration with the zine club, a planned sunrise run before their work session, and inviting Diego and Caroline. Leo agreed to these ideas and suggested incorporating musical cues for the logic puzzles in the mural under the old oak tree. Noor proposed trying chamomile tea during their gathering at the theater, which Leo found perfect. These ongoing conversations further emphasize how these community initiatives aim to bring the town together through shared creativity and collaboration.",
