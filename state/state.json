Peter suggests that Noor, whom he was discussing his school project with earlier, might help bring yoga and fitness elements into their projects. Andy agrees, emphasizing the importance of coordinating schedules later in the day to avoid missing any collaboration opportunities. Later at 8 PM, Andy talks to Diego at the gym about his mural project.
