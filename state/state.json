By the way, Leo mentioned he has your library update for tomorrow's meet-up at Main Street Tacos.\n\nSamantha: That's great! Thanks for reminding me. And speaking of Leo, have you heard his plans for a cat mural at the park? I can't wait to see how it turns out.\n\nCaroline: Absolutely! He's been practicing violin tunes inspired by birds for our evening performances in the park. We should definitely catch up later this week and enjoy some tea together under the stars.\n\nSamantha: Sounds perfect.

It would be great to collaborate on something like that. I'll make sure Peter gets the invite as well.
