Later at 10:00 PM, Caroline thanked Mei for the sunrise seeds and discussed gathering stray cats for the cat mural project under an old oak tree.\n\nAround 11:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Leo at the gym, who was appreciative of the sunrise seeds for his squirrel latte designs and shared that Peter had informed him about their cat mural project. Leo expressed interest in collaborating on the mural designs and serenading Caroline under the gazebo that night after a double date. Caroline agreed to this proposal, making their already wonderful evening even more special. They concluded by planning to collaborate on the mural designs later and meet at the museum before going for tacos together.\n\nAround 1:00 AM, Caroline talked to Noor at the museum. She discussed incorporating sunrise seeds in squirrel latte designs with Noor who was excited about their cat mural project and shared that Samantha wanted to help bring it all together. They also planned an improv session and discussed gathering cats under the old oak tree that night. Noor wished Caroline luck for her gazebo performance, and they agreed to catch up more later.",

Leo reminded Caroline about the stray cats and expressed their importance in the project. Caroline agreed to ensure that they have a memorable night as well.\n\nLater on, at the library, Leo spoke with Peter who appreciated Leo's music and expressed interest in collaborating further on the squirrel latte design.
