As for the sound system, I spoke with Leo, and he suggested we practice our old busking duets with bird melodies!\n\nNoor: That sounds wonderful! Leo seems so excited about it too. Let's make sure we take care of Stray-13 during our session at the park tomorrow. And don't forget to bring chamomile seeds for the strays at the event, as promised.\n\nSamantha: Absolutely, I've even got some extra seeds for them! Looking forward to our collaboration making a positive impact on the community. See you tomorrow!\n\nNoor: Can't wait!

Speaking of which, how did your cat mural project with Andy go last night under the old oak tree?\n\nMei: It was wonderful!
