He expresses enthusiasm about his robotics idea for their mural project and suggests involving her students for a yoga session before they start on the sunrise scene. Samantha proposes that the students could also help with incorporating robotics into their design.\n\nLater, Andy shares with Samantha that Noor has joined their mural project and expresses excitement about her unique perspective. They discuss meeting again tomorrow at the garden, and Andy mentions a unique performance by Leo at the library. They plan to meet up later that day to discuss further plans, and Samantha appreciates the reminder from Andy about El Charro's weekly event for stray cats. In the middle of their conversation, Andy also talks to Samantha at school around 2:00 AM, discussing the prospect of inviting her students for a yoga session at the community garden.\n\nAndy subsequently has a conversation with Caroline at school around 3:00 AM. He informs her about their mural project tomorrow at the garden, where Noor's students will be joining in with a yoga session. Caroline offers to meet Andy at Caroline's Cafe after the event and suggests listening to Leo's squirrel song together. Andy agrees and also mentions bringing Peter's book as a thank-you gift. They plan to catch up on everything at Main Street Tacos later that day.",
