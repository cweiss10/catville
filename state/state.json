Noor suggests bringing treats for the cats during their double date with Peter and Andy. They also discuss involving everyone in the project, particularly Caroline's latte art magic.\n\nCaroline and Diego have conversations at different times. At the museum, they discuss incorporating star constellations into the mural design and plan to stretch before their run the next morning. At school, Caroline suggests Mei's sunrise seeds as a great addition to the mural and they agree to discuss the details over brunch at the library the following day. Mei also confirms that Noor, Diego, Peter, and Leo will be present. The project continues to excite everyone involved and they look forward to seeing it come together.",

The run tomorrow will be a good test.\"\n\nNoor: \"That's great to hear! Let's keep each other updated on our progress, we're in this together.\"",

They also planned to meet at the cafe the following day to finalize plans over a latte, with Leo expressing excitement for Peter's ideas on improvised instruments.\n\nSamantha, who had been invited to collaborate, was thrilled about it and mentioned her bringing a violin for their double date with Mei. Both Peter and Samantha looked forward to the project, with Peter acknowledging the unity and enthusiasm within the community, hoping to make the project magical.\n\nIn the evening, Andy joined the conversation and invited Samantha to participate in the cat mural project as well. Leo shared his plan to involve Peter in a bird duet at the hospital. They agreed on meeting at 10 PM for chamomile tea with stray cats before the event, and decided to have street tacos together after their shared endeavor.\n\nDuring these conversations, Diego joined the project, offering to add rhythm with his footwork during the musical sunrise under the old oak tree. He appreciated being involved in Leo's projects, which helped keep his mind off his injured knee. The group continued to express excitement and look forward to making magic happen together.\n\nDuring a hospital visit, Samantha discussed the musical event with Leo, mentioning her new design incorporating headphones into the project. They agreed on testing its compatibility with the violin under the moonlight at the musical sunrise.",
