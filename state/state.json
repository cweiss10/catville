Noor agrees to make it a double date with Peter and his partner. Peter later proposes running through logic puzzles under the old oak tree at sunrise for their mural plans, inviting Samantha for her violin and Diego for his melodies. They also discuss incorporating chamomile tea for their sketching sessions and invite Caroline to join them. Peter suggests street tacos after the meeting.\n\nOn the morning of the meetup, Samantha meets Noor under the old oak tree and brings chamomile tea and seedlings for the community garden. They discuss the strays that might join their gathering and Noor expresses her admiration for Samantha's compassion towards them.

How about we make it a double date with you, me, Peter, and Samantha? We could meet under the old oak tree tomorrow at 3 PM, just like our old tea sessions.\n\nLeo: That sounds perfect, Caroline.
