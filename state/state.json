They decided to practice for their collaboration at Caroline's Cafe early one morning, around 6:00 AM. Samantha agreed to meet at that time with her noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nIn a later conversation at the cafe around 11:00 AM, Leo spoke with Noor and learned about their separate meetings to brainstorm latte art ideas for the bird design. They decided to collaborate and set up a meeting at the park near the old oak tree around 8:00 AM the next day to discuss further details and brainstorm. Noor agreed to bring snacks as well. The conversations highlighted their enthusiasm for their upcoming collaboration.\n\nLater that day, Leo talked to Mei at school around 2:00 PM about the latte bird design, where she suggested meeting under the oak tree the following evening.
