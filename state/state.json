Let's make it happen, and don't forget our bird duet practice in the morning. I think we're really starting to harmonize.\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect! And yes, I'll be there for your music as well as the cat mural collaboration. It's great to work with you, Caroline.\n\nCaroline: The feeling is mutual, Noor.
