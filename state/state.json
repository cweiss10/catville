They discussed inviting Mei, who had sunrise seeds for the mural, to join their meeting the next day. Leo also learned that Samantha was going on a date with Diego and wished them a cozy double date.\n\nThese additional conversations continue to indicate that all three projects aim to bring the town closer together, with collaborations between various community members and groups.
