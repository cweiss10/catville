Andy later talks to Samantha at home around 11:00 AM who shares that Mei's sketches are incredible and suggests collaborating with Leo on the bird designs for the mural, which they plan to discuss further at their meeting at the community center tomorrow.\n\nAt 1:00 PM, Andy talks to Diego at a train station about grabbing tacos after their mural meeting with Mei, and Diego agrees to meet again downtown after wrapping up at the old oak tree. They also discuss bringing chamomile seeds for Mei and other necessary items like stretch mats, headphones, and snacks.\n\nLater in the evening around 10:00 PM, Andy talks to Diego again at the theater about the planned tacos after their meeting with Mei, and they reaffirm their plans to bring chamomile seeds and other items. They express excitement about the upcoming project.",
