Remember how much everyone loved your chili lime latte?\n\nCaroline: Oh, absolutely! I was thinking of using that as inspiration for a special drink during our collaboration event. And speaking of which, did you get a chance to discuss with Noor about the violin duet and Peter's latte art skills?\n\nDiego: Yes, we did. We're excited about it all. I've been stretching my knee every day to be ready for our meeting under the old oak tree. How's everything going with your side of things?\n\nCaroline: Things are coming together nicely. Samantha and Andy are on board, and Luna will be looked after during the event.

They decided to have energizing tacos before their meeting, and later discussions at Caroline's café. Leo promised to bring cat food for Luna during the library community event.\n\nLater in the day, around 2 PM, Leo had a conversation with Peter at the park about ideas for the violin design they were discussing for the mural. They agreed to catch up on these discussions over coffee at Caroline's café that evening before their planned meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow.
