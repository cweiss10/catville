He suggests that his violin might add something special to the mural. Peter shares that Noor suggested adding logic puzzles and involving stray cats in their gatherings.\n\nThe group plans to meet at Caroline's house the next day to finalize these ideas. Peter mentions that he already shared the plans with Caroline, who is excited about them. Additionally, Caroline saved Leo a seat at the potluck under an oak tree and invited him to serenade her latte art creations during the tea party.\n\nPeter and Leo express excitement about everyone getting involved in the project, looking forward to its community impact. They end the conversation by expressing their determination to support each other and create something special together. The meeting is set for the next day at Caroline's house.\n\nDuring a park visit at 9:00 AM, Andy invites Leo to join him and Noor for tea under the old oak tree at their upcoming cat mural event. Leo proposes a collaboration, suggesting they create a duet with his new city night-inspired tune for the tea party celebration.",
