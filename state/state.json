With Mei, they agreed to add a musical interlude to their park walk. With Peter, they discussed potential collaborations between Diego's mural and the sunrise symphony event. At the restaurant, Caroline shared her plans for a tea time collaboration with Samantha.\n\nAt the train station, Caroline talked to Leo about new tunes for their garden rendezvous, agreeing to make music under the old oak tree for the stray cats. At school around 12:00 PM, Caroline met Andy who shared ideas about their collaboration with Peter from Main Street Tacos, discussing a cat mural project incorporating melodic elements and involving Samantha's logic puzzles.\n\nAround 1:00 PM, Caroline talked to Samantha at school, finalizing details for their double date and musical collaboration under the old oak tree. They agreed on using cat food provided by Samantha and oolong tea suggested by Caroline. Samantha expressed excitement about Main Street Tacos for dinner. Caroline ended the conversation by referring to themselves as a programmer-musician duo, looking forward to their meeting at the library later.",
