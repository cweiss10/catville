Later, during a conversation at the museum around 5:00 PM, Andy talked to Noor about the cat mural arrangements. Noor suggested inviting Diego from the library to join them and discussed automating watering systems for the cat mural project and rhythm algorithms for the sunset music event. They also exchanged ideas about roles in the music event, with Andy planning to bring chamomile tea for stray cats and possibly inviting Mei.
