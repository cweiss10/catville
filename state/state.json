They discussed their successful turnout for the project, appreciated each other's contributions, and planned a unique sunrise symphony involving chamomile tea for Stray-13 and a bird duet violin.\n\nAt 11:00 PM, Leo and Mei under the old oak tree also discussed his new bird duet partner and her bringing sunrise seeds for the mural. They planned to stretch before starting, and Mei inquired about Leo's conversations with Peter and Andy regarding their collaborations and rehearsals under the old oak tree. Leo confirmed that both were excited to participate, and they agreed to invite Diego to the rehearsal, as the mural was coming together nicely.\n\nIn addition, at 6:00 AM, Leo spoke with Caroline at the town hall where she expressed her excitement for their double date at Main Street Tacos and the cat mural project. Leo shared that he had been practicing his bird duets to add a special touch to Peter's old violin and mentioned that Diego might join them for rehearsals, which Caroline thought was wonderful. She also emphasized the importance of maintaining a cozy vibe throughout their collaborative efforts.",
