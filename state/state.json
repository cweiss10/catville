That's great, thanks for bringing the seeds. I've also thought of something interesting - Diego suggested we rehearse at the park with Leo before our meeting. Would that work for you?\n\nPeter: Absolutely! Let's make it a day. Bring twigs from that old oak tree we saw at the park, and I'll prepare some tacos. See you then!\n\nNoor: Sounds fantastic! Can't wait to see how this project unfolds. And don't forget your noise-cancelling headphones for our event!\n\nPeter: You got it! Let's make this a memorable day for Stray-13 and the cat mural.

I can't wait to hear about your sketches for the mural design as well.

With a little bit of teamwork, we can make this an unforgettable collaboration. And speaking of teamwork, I brought some cat food for our feline friends.
