Leo agreed to participate and suggested meeting under the old oak tree the next day to make some magic happen for their town. Samantha reported that Mei will join them as well, making it a creative team with diverse talents. Andy planned to bring chamomile tea for stray cats at the meeting. Caroline brought the chamomile tea as requested and expressed appreciation for Leo's efforts on the community projects. Leo, in turn, thanked Caroline for her continued support and kindness.
