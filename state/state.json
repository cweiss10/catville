Additionally, they make plans to rehearse at the park that afternoon as Mei has some musical ideas to share. At around 2:00 AM, the human talks to Caroline at a cafe, where Leo shares exciting details about their new bird duet collaboration with Noor and Diego, involving Noor's students for a squirrel latte art design. They also plan to meet Mei after yoga stretches this afternoon to discuss more musical ideas, and Caroline expresses her excitement for all these creative endeavors.",

We'll meet at the gazebo this week to finalize our plans. Mei has an interesting idea about incorporating bird duets too.\n\nLeo: Sounds amazing! I suggested involving Noor in the project as well, and we agreed to practice together at the park this week. Have you thought about Diego contributing to the fresh bean part of the mural?\n\nAndy: Good idea! I'll reach out to him today. Speaking of which, have you tried that squirrel latte art performance idea for the mural yet?\n\nLeo: Not yet, but I think it could add a unique touch. By the way, did you remember to save some tacos for neighborhood cats during our community celebration?\n\nAndy: Yes, of course! Can't forget about them. Let's grab some tacos and discuss everything in more detail at Main Street Tacos this evening. Caroline mentioned she wanted to join us, right?\n\nLeo: That's right! Looking forward to our quadruple date with her this weekend. See you there, Andy!\n\nAndy: You too, Leo! Have a great day!",
