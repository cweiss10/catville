They plan to meet at Main Street Tacos on Thursday.\n\nDuring lunchtime, Andy spoke with Mei who informed him that Diego is excited about their cat feeding station idea and has a surprise planned for Thursday. Mei also shared her preparations for a quadruple date, where Leo will perform bird songs on his violin as a duet in the park.\n\nLater, Andy caught up with Caroline at town_hall around 2:00 PM and they discussed their collaboration on the mural, with Andy learning that Caroline has also spoken to Mei about Leo's squirrel tunes. Both are excited about incorporating Leo's music in the mural and look forward to their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation around 3:00 PM, Andy suggests adding yoga before rehearsals for a unique twist in their park performance. Mei agrees, suggesting they discuss more details later that day at the train station.\n\nAround 9:00 PM, Andy talks to Leo at the gym. He proposes incorporating Leo's squirrel tunes into the cat project at El Charro and invites him to collaborate with kids from the community center for a bird duet performance. Leo agrees and suggests meeting at Main Street Tacos that night. He also invites Mei and Samantha, and mentions bringing Diego along to discuss the mural project as well. Everyone looks forward to creating something magical together.",

We're collaborating on the squirrel tunes for the mural and he suggested we meet at Main Street Tacos tomorrow to finalize things.\n\nNoor: That sounds wonderful, Peter! And speaking of collaborations, I think your yoga session idea is brilliant. Samantha's excited about it too. Let's make sure our routines complement each other during the sessions. By the way, how's Diego's knee doing?\n\nPeter: His knee's looking good. Thanks for reminding me about that. And I'm glad you approve of the yoga idea. Looking forward to our meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow. Plus, I can't wait for the quadruple date next week!",
