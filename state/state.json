Around 8:00 PM, Andy spoke to Diego at the gym about their ongoing projects. At 11:00 PM, Andy met Mei at a cafe, where they shared their excitement about the mechanical birds in the cat mural collaboration. Mei felt it was a perfect blend of her ideas and Diego's city sounds, making the project feel like a dream come true for them all. Both looked forward to an exciting event that would bring creative energy and memorable moments to their town.",

See you there soon.\n\nCaroline: Wonderful! I can't wait. Oh, and don't forget that Peter will join us with cat stretches and chamomile lattes. Let's create something special together.\n\nLeo: Can't argue with that. Looking forward to it. See you soon, Caroline.",
