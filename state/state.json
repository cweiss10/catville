They also look forward to their double date with Caroline and Andy this weekend, as well as discussing gym routines from Diego to help Peter's knee.\n\nPeter mentions Andy's suggestion of incorporating sunrise seeds into future compositions, reminding Leo about Andy's idea for the cat mural project. During a conversation with Andy at school, Andy suggests using sunrise seeds in their collaboration, and they discuss Noor's idea, which seems perfect. They plan to further discuss this collaboration under the old oak tree that evening before running together as usual. They are excited about another day of creativity and friendship.",
