Let's meet under the old oak tree this weekend after the garden meeting with Mei. We can share some chamomile tea and talk through the progress of our project.\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect. And don't forget about involving my robotics club in the zine club meetings too!\n\nCaroline: Of course, collaboration is what makes this project special. Let's make sure the cozy vibe of the cafe carries over to our discussions. See you on Saturday!",

I'll bring my headphones tomorrow under the oak tree so we can finalize it together. I've been working on some noise-cancelling features, hoping it'll help with his sensitivity.\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic!

They discussed collaboration, rehearsing under the old oak tree, using Peter's violin for bird duets, and bringing chamomile tea for stray cats. Peter shared that he had already spoken to Noor about the project earlier that day at the station.\n\nAt 5:00 AM, Leo spoke with Andy at school. They discussed finalizing cat mural designs, rehearsing under the old oak tree together, and incorporating chamomile tea and Peter's violin in the mural design. Andy mentioned that he and others had been discussing ideas with Mei and Noor. Leo suggested that Diego might join their rehearsals under the old oak tree the next day.",
