We'll meet at the gazebo this week to finalize our plans. Mei has an interesting idea about incorporating bird duets too.\n\nLeo: Sounds amazing! I suggested involving Noor in the project as well, and we agreed to practice together at the park this week. Have you thought about Diego contributing to the fresh bean part of the mural?\n\nAndy: Good idea! I'll reach out to him today. Speaking of which, have you tried that squirrel latte art performance idea for the mural yet?\n\nLeo: Not yet, but I think it could add a unique touch. By the way, did you remember to save some tacos for neighborhood cats during our community celebration?\n\nAndy: Yes, of course! Can't forget about them. Let's grab some tacos and discuss everything in more detail at Main Street Tacos this evening. Caroline mentioned she wanted to join us, right?\n\nLeo: That's right!
