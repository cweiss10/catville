Later, they discussed practicing a bird duet near the park's old oak tree and collecting twigs and leaves for improvised instruments.\n\nPeter mentioned Mei discussing sunrise seeds at the train station, and both were excited about their creative collaborations. In the evening, Leo spoke to Mei at a cafe where they agreed to meet under the old oak tree the following day to discuss the cat mural project and sunrise seeds, with Diego bringing chamomile tea. They also talked about a potential melody for the event's music suggested by Noor.\n\nLater that night, Leo spoke to Andy at the train station around 12:00 AM, where Andy proposed incorporating Leo's violin melodies into the cat mural project and suggested they invite Mei, Peter, Leo, and Noor under a gazebo the following afternoon. They also discussed treating stray cats with chamomile tea on their way to the meeting and looked forward to their collaboration.",

We're incorporating your musical ideas into the design.\n\nSamantha: (smiles) That's exciting! I'm looking forward to it. By the way, did you remember the chamomile for the strays?\n\nLeo: Of course, I wouldn't forget that. We make a good team, don't we?
