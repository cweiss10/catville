At a cafe around 10:00 AM, Noor expresses excitement about the upcoming event, and Leo agrees that everyone's contributions will make it unforgettable. They also discuss collaborating on a symphony-like project using sunrise seeds for Leo's violin performance under the gazebo trees. Samantha later agrees to this idea and suggests discussing more over tea. By the end of these conversations, they plan to create magic with their combined efforts under the gazebo trees.",
