Let's make sure to involve Andy in our project, too – his automation ideas might come in handy.

Sharing excitement about these projects, they express admiration for each other and feel like they have found a home together.\n\nLater in the day, Leo talks to Peter around 9:00 AM about street tacos for their run the following day. They discuss the mural rhythm algorithm, stray cat food, improv duet ideas from Noor for the park scene in the mural, and involve Caroline's idea of using her spot in the cat mural for their gathering. Peter suggests inviting Noor to play the violin at the event, making cat food samples for Stray-13, involving Mei in their community project due to her unique talent for rhythm-based designs, and collaborating with her on the algorithm for the rhythm-based elements of their mural.\n\nLeo suggests meeting at Main Street Tacos after breakfast the next day to discuss everything in more detail, including an automated watering system and involving Samantha in their work. Mei promises a violin serenade under the old oak tree, and they agree to make the town's creative spirit shine brighter than ever by making the events unforgettable for everyone involved. They plan to meet again at 11:00 AM the next day, with Peter looking forward to their theater duet.",
