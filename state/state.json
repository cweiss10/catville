Also, Caroline and I are planning a bird duet under the oak tree tomorrow evening.\n\nNoor: Oh, that's perfect! We should do a double date with Peter there. He mentioned something about discussing sunrise seeds and chamomile tea for strays too.\n\nLeo: That sounds lovely. And speaking of strays, I think Diego might bring some chamomile tea to our meeting under the oak tree tomorrow as well.\n\nNoor: Great! I can't wait to hear about the progress on the cat mural project. Peter mentioned Mei discussing sunrise seeds for it at the train station. Let's collaborate more on that melody Noor suggested, shall we?\n\nLeo: Definitely, Noor! Looking forward to our creative session tomorrow under the oak tree with all our ideas coming together.",
