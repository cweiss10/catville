They discuss a squirrel design for the cat mural project and agree to impress Caroline with their A-game.\n\nLater that night, around 1:00 AM, the human talks to Mei at a restaurant. Mei shares that she will help with the cat mural project in the morning at the garden and suggests brainstorming for musical collaborations at Main Street Tacos during the week. They also discuss a fitness demonstration collaboration at the museum next week. Leo promises to work on something special for the community celebration.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, the human talks to Andy at a town hall, where they discuss their mural project and collaborative efforts with Noor, Peter, and Diego. They agree to keep in touch about their plans and make the mural a memorable one for everyone involved.\n\nLater, Leo has a conversation with Peter at school around 12:00 PM, discussing a possible old oak tree near the gazebo as a suitable addition to their cat mural project. Peter agrees to check out the tree and looks forward to seeing Leo's design sketches later that day.\n\nIn the evening, Peter proposes a meeting with Leo at Main Street Tacos tomorrow for discussing the cat mural details, involving Noor in the bird duet idea, collaborating with Diego's robotics club on squirrel designs, and integrating Leo's improvised bird songs into the mural's ambience. They also plan to discuss everything with Samantha about the interactive puzzles and open-source library. Both are excited for a productive collaboration.",
