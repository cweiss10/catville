We'll gather them together before dinner tonight, as planned. By the way, your chamomile tea idea is brilliant; it should help us all stay calm before the improv session.\n\nNoor: Agreed! I'm so excited about this collaboration. Let's make sure to include Samantha too – she's been a big supporter of these community events.\n\nPeter: You're right, Noor.

They also discuss further plans for the cat mural project under the gazebo trees tonight.\n\nDuring a conversation with Mei at the park around 12:00 PM, Leo expresses excitement about joining her for the improv session and talks about the creativity of the squirrel latte design. They reminisce about their Saturday zine club discussions about community art projects and look forward to the cat mural being a special blend of nature, music, and town spirit.",
