Later, Mei spoke to Leo at home about the project, and he suggested adding more interactive elements.\n\nIn the meantime, Mei discussed the mural with Caroline at the gym around 4:00 PM. They talked about possible city sounds for the mural, with both agreeing on mechanical birds singing in harmony with a violin serenade. Noor also invited Caroline to join Mei and Samantha under the old oak tree tomorrow. Additionally, Mei and Samantha planned to meet at a restaurant that night to discuss more mural ideas and make their town stronger. Their enthusiasm for the project continued to grow as they looked forward to collaborating and making a positive impact on their community.",
