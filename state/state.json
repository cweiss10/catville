They also plan to have tacos together, share seeds for their community garden, and bring treats for neighborhood cats during their meetings.\n\nIn another conversation, Peter expresses excitement about collaborating with Noor on the cat mural project, especially incorporating music into it. Noor invites Samantha to join as well, believing her skills could be beneficial for their robotics club project. This collaboration demonstrates how their passions align despite coming from different worlds.\n\nLater, Peter contacts Noor at a museum around 2:00 PM. He's heard about the surprise bird duet in the park and the community collaboration with the cat mural project. Peter agrees to dive deeper into that gallery show and mentions that he'll bring garden seeds for their mural design.
