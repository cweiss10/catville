Let's get him involved, I think it could really elevate our work. And speaking of Caroline, have you talked to her about Diego's squirrel tunes at the park? She has some noise-cancelling headphones that might come in handy.\n\nAndy: Yes, we discussed it! She said she'd bring them tomorrow for the yoga session. By the way, I met Mei today and we exchanged seeds for stray cats. We're meeting at Main Street Tacos tonight to discuss more about the mural design, including incorporating Leo's squirrel song.\n\nNoor: That's fantastic! I'll see you both there then. And Andy, you know how much I appreciate your mentorship and creativity. This project is going to be something special.\n\nAndy: I couldn't agree more, Noor. Let's make this mural a memory worth remembering for our community. See you at Main Street Tacos tonight!",
