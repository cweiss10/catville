At 4:00 PM, Diego spoke to Leo who shared plans for an improvised bird duet performance during the cat mural session, suggesting noise-cancelling headphones to avoid disturbing neighbors and bringing seeds for stray cats. Later in the day, Diego talked to Andy at the theater who suggested incorporating sunrise seeds from Noor's garden into the cat mural design.\n\nAt a cafe around 4:00 AM, Diego spoke to Caroline about the cat mural project. They discussed Noor's ideas for incorporating robotics into the design, collaborating with Mei's garden seeds, involving Noor's students in the design discussions, and starting a garden at the park as a nod to their favorite cafe. Peter then joined the conversation around 5:00 AM and suggested involving Diego's robotics club for an interactive tree near the gazebo, which Diego agreed to discuss further at Main Street Tacos tomorrow morning. Peter also mentioned Noor's idea for using noise-cancelling headphones for the birds and Leo's bird improvisation plans.
