Peter proposes an earth-tones theme for their cat nook project, inspired by Leo's knack for incorporating nature into his art. Leo suggests that a squirrel-themed song he's working on for the musical could inspire the cat project. Peter suggests a collaborative meeting tonight at El Charro to discuss both projects and make progress on Leo's squirrel song, inviting Diego and Caroline. Leo agrees, looking forward to their park duet tomorrow and collaboration on the projects. The group plans to adapt and continue working together, as they once did running together.",
