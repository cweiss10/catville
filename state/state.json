Do join us if you can!\n\nMei: Sounds delightful! I'll bring seeds for the project and some noise-cancelling headphones Samantha suggested for focus aids.

Did you know he wants to meet tonight after rehearsal with Samantha?\n\nNoor: Yes! I've been talking about it with Diego and Mei too. We're all meeting under the old oak tree later. Maybe Leo can share those sketches with us then?\n\nCaroline: That sounds perfect. Let's make sure we keep this place as cozy as ever while we work on our creative endeavors, alright?\n\nNoor: Agreed! And don't forget to bring chamomile seeds for the strays at the event.
