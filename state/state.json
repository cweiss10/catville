Andy reminded Diego to bring noise-cancelling headphones, cat treats, and sunrise seeds. Diego expressed his excitement about collaborating with gym routine ideas.\n\nAt 1 PM, Andy spoke to Noor at the park about making it a regular activity to spend time with and show extra love to the strays in their local town, which Noor thought was a great idea. They agreed on this new activity being beneficial both for the cats and their team bonding.\n\nLater at 11 PM, Andy talked to Noor at the market about adding a special touch to their cat mural project under the gazebo trees that night. They decided to perform a bird duet and invited Mei to bring snacks, with Diego providing cat food for the stray cats. All participants expressed excitement about making their town proud with this project.\n\nAt 12 AM, Andy talked to Samantha at the park and proposed meeting under the gazebo trees the next day at 11 AM to discuss the cat mural project further. Samantha agreed and mentioned bringing headphones for the meeting and some snacks for their community event.\n\nDuring this conversation, Andy suggested to Noor that they perform a bird duet during their brainstorming session under the gazebo, making it a tradition to celebrate their progress on the cat mural project. Noor also shared her idea about incorporating snacks for overwhelmed students into the design of the cat mural.",
