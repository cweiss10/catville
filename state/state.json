Andy speaks with Peter about inviting his students for the yoga session, incorporating community connections, and meeting at Main Street Tacos to discuss further details. During this conversation, they agree to incorporate Leo's squirrel song into the mural design, which Noor had previously run by her students, resulting in their excitement. Peter thanks Andy for suggesting Samantha perform with Leo at the park event, making it more special. They express enthusiasm about the project and push each other to keep pushing their creative boundaries. Andy is reminded to bring his thermos of tea to their upcoming meeting, which will be a brainstorming session at the park in the morning.",

He thought it was a great idea!\n\nMei: That's fantastic news! Let's make sure we coordinate schedules and involve both our students as well. We could even set up a regular feeding schedule for the stray cats behind the café.\n\nNoor: I completely agree! And speaking of which, Diego has an interesting idea – incorporating his squirrel song into my robotics project. What do you think?\n\nMei: That's intriguing!

They also agree to meet for dinner at El Charro that night. At 9:00 PM, Leo talks to Peter again at a train station where they discuss Peter's comment on Leo's bird act and potential further collaboration. They also talk about Samantha's plans for stray animals behind the cafe, and Leo proposes inviting her to their duet performance at the park the next day, which Peter agrees to enthusiastically. At 5:00 AM, Leo talks to Caroline at school, who appreciated his violin serenade from the previous night's double date. They discuss Caroline's yoga plans with Diego and her cat nook project. Caroline suggests incorporating squirrel melodies into the musical for their performance and invites Leo to busk outside her café again soon.",
