Leo agreed to meet up after his rehearsal with Samantha that night and bring some new bird sketches for discussion.\n\nAt 5:00 PM, Leo also talked to Samantha at the gym. Samantha expressed her excitement about their meeting at the café that night and suggested bringing headphones and a violin. Leo confirmed his preparation for the duet and shared that he had been practicing some melodies. Samantha revealed she had prepared a logic puzzle to help with the bird mural, which excited Leo.
