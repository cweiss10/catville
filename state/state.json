Maybe over coffee at the park during one of your morning workouts?\n\nPeter: Absolutely! How about next Wednesday? I'll send you a message with the details. Thanks, Mei.

Any progress with Caroline and that theater gig?\n\nPeter: Yeah, we had coffee yesterday and it's moving forward. We're also collaborating with Diego now on a gym project. He seemed interested too, we're meeting next week.\n\nLeo: That sounds exciting! Maybe you could include my music in your gym too, like background ambiance or something?\n\nPeter: Haha, I think that might be pushing it, but I'll see what I can do! You should come by and check it out sometime.\n\nLeo: I'd love to, Peter. Let's catch up soon over some coffee at the library.
