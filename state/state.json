Later, at a theater, Caroline talks to Leo about her latte art concepts for both the city sounds project and the cat mural project, which includes a mechanical bird design. They express excitement about the collaboration.\n\nLater in the day, Caroline meets Andy at a cafe, where she reveals that she has incorporated his cat mural sketches into her latte art. Andy appreciates the gesture and inquires about the taco meeting under the oak tree. Caroline confirms they will present their ideas there, including the mechanical bird design for the cat mural project. They both discuss overcoming creative blocks and agree that the collaboration could be a success. They also express a desire to find more time for impromptu duets.\n\nIn separate conversations, Diego offers stretching routines, plans to discuss more ideas over street tacos, and mentions involving his patients from the gym into the project. Caroline assures him she has extra mint leaves for Peter's tea. Noor shares her positive experience with chamomile in her latte and mentions incorporating her robotic birds into the city sounds project at the gym. They both agree to attend the taco meeting under the oak tree and collaborate on the cat mural project, discussing bringing snacks for any overwhelmed students.",

All meetings are still scheduled for the following day. Noor updates on making great progress with Peter on the mural garden project, and they discuss performing an impromptu duet during taco night under the oak tree at a later date.",
