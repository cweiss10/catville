Let's make this a memorable night.\n\nLeo: Speaking of memories, I hope you still remember that violin duet we did with the birds in the park? Let's recreate it tonight!\n\nPeter: Of course, that was one of my favorite moments. It'll be just like old times. See you there, Leo.\n\nLeo: Can't wait, Peter. See you soon!",
