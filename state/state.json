Samantha thought Leo's city sounds ideas were perfect for their project, and they all agreed to meet under the old oak tree tomorrow with Andy, Noor, Diego, Peter, Mei, and Caroline in attendance. They also discussed making the event unique and memorable, rescheduling their meeting due to Andy needing to attend the hospital instead of the park. It will be a double date under the stars.
