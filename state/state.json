They also discuss providing chamomile tea for stray cats as part of the project.\n\nLater in the morning at a restaurant around 5 AM, Andy proposes a new time for the gathering and Samantha agrees, offering to ask Diego about joining for stretching exercises. The group also includes Leo, who has been working on incorporating improv into the cat mural project since their previous conversation at the library. Leo plans to share new musical ideas with them tonight under the old oak tree. Andy brings chamomile tea for the stray cats as a tribute to their last gathering there. Diego will be joining them at Main Street Tacos tonight. Both Samantha and Andy are excited about the creative and collaborative gathering the following day.\n\nIn addition, Leo invites Diego to join him at a later meeting tonight under the old oak tree to discuss further musical ideas for the cat mural project.",

That works perfectly for me, and it sounds like a fantastic idea. Let's make sure we discuss plans for both the cat mural project and the community garden.\n\nCaroline: Absolutely! I've been thinking about some exciting ideas for the mural, and I'd love to hear your thoughts too. And don't forget to bring your seeds for our stray cat friends!\n\nMei: Of course! I also wanted to share an update about the improv performance and cheetah sculpture we discussed with Samantha at the library. It looks like we can include that in our plans as well.\n\nCaroline: That sounds amazing, Mei! I'm looking forward to seeing everyone later, especially since Diego mentioned he'd be joining us.
