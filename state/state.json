Andy suggests a collaboration with Diego for incorporating city sounds into the mechanical birds, and they plan to have pre-session tacos with Diego, Mei, and Leo under the old oak tree. Excitement builds as they look forward to blending their collective efforts for these community events.\n\nDuring the day, Andy talks to Diego at the market, inviting him to join the mechanical birds project and proposing a cat mural and zine collaboration. Diego agrees to incorporate city sounds into the mechanical birds and suggests having chamomile lattes before finalizing everything under the old oak tree. They plan to meet at the market the next day with mint sprigs and look forward to a productive day followed by some delicious street tacos post-event.",
