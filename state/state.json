I was actually discussing it with Mei at the train station. How about we use some robotics club materials for our community event?\n\nAndy: Absolutely! And maybe Diego can help with both projects? We should finalize the details over breakfast at the community center tomorrow.\n\nNoor: Sounds good, Andy. I'll bring some chamomile tea for the animals at Caroline's café too. How about we meet again for lunch to plan our collaboration effectively?\n\nAndy: Perfect! I can't wait to work together on this. See you tomorrow morning at the community center.",

Additionally, they discuss expanding the sunrise seed idea into their cat mural project and Mei's zine club.\n\nLater in the day (3:00 PM), Noor brainstorms ideas for their event and suggests incorporating Leo's bird improvisations during the cat mural unveiling, as well as starting with an impromptu jam at the gazebo and having a symphony under the old oak tree. Leo agrees to these ideas and they decide to keep each other updated on their projects.",
