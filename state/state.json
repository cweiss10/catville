Andy talks to Diego at the gym around 4:00 PM about joining the tea party meeting.\n\nAndy meets Samantha at the library around 9:00 PM to discuss city sounds for their mechanical birds project, where they decide to involve Mei's students in the jam session and invite Leo to collaborate on the bird melodies. In another conversation at a cafe around 10:00 PM, Andy learns that Caroline will bring fresh mint tea for the gathering under the old oak tree later that day, and Diego suggests bringing Whiskers' brother's designs ready for review beforehand.\n\nIn additional conversations, Andy talks to Noor at the park around 1:00 AM about finalizing their cat mural plans, incorporating mechanical birds from her robotics club, inviting Mei and Samantha's class for the tea party under the old oak tree, and asking Diego to join them. They also agree on involving Whiskers' brother in the project and plan a surprise appearance at the meeting. Peter is excited about the collaborative projects and emphasizes their potential impact on their community.\n\nIn the subsequent conversations, Andy talks to Mei at a restaurant around 6:00 AM about the tea party under the old oak tree. Mei suggests inviting Noor and discusses label ideas with Andy for the cat mural project. Andy informs Mei that Caroline will bring street tacos for the gathering and that they are looking forward to it, as it promises to be a special day for their town.\n\nIn another conversation at a park around 9:00 AM, Andy invites Leo to join the tea party under the old oak tree later in the day. Leo accepts, promising to bring his violin for some impromptu melodies during the discussion about the mechanical birds project.",
