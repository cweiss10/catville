In the evening of the same day, Leo met Caroline at the cafe where they discussed city sounds for their mechanical bird project. They decided to invite Mei and Diego to join them under the old oak tree that night for a collaborative session. Later in the conversation, Diego informed Leo that he was ready to meet him, along with their plans for street tacos and a violin duet under the old oak tree.
