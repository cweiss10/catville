And speaking of which, Caroline mentioned inviting them to our meeting tomorrow as well. How about we also discuss starting a garden at the park like she suggested?\n\nDiego: Sounds great, Noor! I've been thinking we should incorporate those squirrel characters Samantha wants to do in latte art. Let's make sure to bring the cozy vibe from our favorite cafe into this collaboration. Plus, I'd love to stay on track with our gym sessions so we can keep each other motivated.\n\nNoor: Agreed! Don't forget that Caroline mentioned a bird duet performance planned for the park in the morning. Let's make sure to keep that in mind while we're working on the mural. Also, let's make time for that quadruple date after the project is complete, as promised.\n\nDiego: Count me in! I'm looking forward to it all, Noor. See you at 3 PM sharp tomorrow at the park. Remember our gym sessions too!\n\nNoor: You got it, Diego. Stay focused and see you there! And hey, I'll make sure to bring a snack for any overwhelmed students who happen to drop by during our mural session.",
