Let's make sure we practice together during that session. Also, thanks for accepting the double date this Thursday at Main Street Tacos. Looking forward to it!\n\nLeo: That sounds like fun. I'm curious to know more about Diego and his knee injury. How's he doing?\n\nAndy: He's improving gradually, but we still need to reschedule our taco night. Hopefully soon though! Take care, Leo.
