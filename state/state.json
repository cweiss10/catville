With Mei at the theater around 1:00 PM, they talked about squirrel latte art involving Noor's students and a bird duet. Leo shared his new piece 'Canon in D'. They also spoke to Peter at home around 2:00 PM regarding further details for the cat mural project, incorporating bird duets, and involving Diego and Samantha in their squirrel project.\n\nDuring another conversation at the theater around 3:00 PM, Andy invited Leo for an afternoon practice session of their bird duets at Main Street Tacos after the show, which they agreed upon, also planning to discuss roles in both projects and cat mural details. Later in the day, Peter contacted Leo around 9:00 PM with updates on the cat mural project due to a collaboration with Noor on the squirrel latte art. They decided to practice together at the park the next day before their taco meeting, and also planned to discuss more ideas over tacos that night. They also reminded each other about feeding the neighborhood cats during their meeting next Saturday.\n\nLater in the evening, Mei contacted Leo at home around 11:00 PM, discussing the 'Canon in D' design for the squirrel latte art and suggesting a yoga session and bird duet rehearsal. Leo agreed to showcase the design the following day during their meeting at the park. Andy contacted Leo at the park around 12:00 AM, proposing a collaboration on the cat mural, incorporating bird duets into the design. They arranged a meeting later in the week to discuss details and invited Samantha for a bird duet event at the park the following morning. During their separate tasks – Andy teaching kids and sketching sunrise, while Leo played his violin near the market – Andy suggested using Mei's garden seeds in the cat mural design to create a lively scene.",

I might have a musical idea to complement it.
