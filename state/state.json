Mei agrees, suggesting they meet at the cafe first to blend ideas about mechanical birds, murals, and latte art. They invite Leo and his students, as well as Noor from the robotics club, to join the discussion. The group plans to continue their tradition of street tacos afterward. Additionally, they discuss Noor's purple hair inspiration that she plans to incorporate into her robotic creations, which should make for an interesting blend of art forms. They express excitement about continuing to champion their small rituals and the power they have in making strong towns.",
