In addition, Andy and Mei discuss incorporating quiet spaces in their gallery show, as well as sunrise seeds for the ritual garden. Mei confirms that Diego has the required seeds and suggests a brainstorming session today at Main Street Tacos, inviting Diego to join them.\n\nDuring conversations with various individuals, Andy learns about Leo's musical idea for the cat mural project, expresses enthusiasm, and plans a bird duet practice in the park tomorrow before their meeting at Main Street Tacos. During this meeting, they also plan to grab tacos for the neighborhood cats. Leo suggests an improvised violin performance for Andy's solo gallery show at the café, and they decide to discuss further during their practice session tomorrow. They express excitement about collaborating on these projects and look forward to their continued artistic partnership.",

Samantha appreciates Caroline's enthusiasm for the mural project and finds her latte art ideas unique. She mentions her ability to blend technology and art in her projects and expresses eagerness to see how they will collaborate on the cat mural project. They discuss making sure the cats enjoy their treats during rehearsals, with Samantha suggesting using noise-cancelling headphones for fewer distractions. Caroline suggests meeting earlier at the park tomorrow, which works for Samantha as she will be there with her yoga students ready to collaborate on the sunrise seeds theme.
