Let's set up a quiet corner at the library to discuss the progress without disturbing others, if that works for you?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely! And since Andy will be there, I can invite him as well.

I'd love to collaborate with Noor on it and see what kind of harmonies we can create together.\n\nPeter: That sounds fantastic, Leo!
