They spoke about the cat mural design they had discussed earlier at the hospital and agreed to finalize the details under the old oak tree after Peter's gathering tomorrow. They also planned to discuss the rhythm for their event with Diego and Leo there too. Mei mentioned that Diego had shared something about Peter bringing his cat mural design, which Caroline had not yet spoken to him about. Regarding their café vibe, Caroline shared latte art ideas inspired by the community garden, which Mei found perfect. They both looked forward to seeing how it all comes together. The collaborations among the group members are progressing, bringing everyone closer together.",

I think we're onto something special.\n\nNoor: That sounds amazing! Let's make sure to meet under the old oak tree tomorrow to discuss further. And don't forget, you owe me some of Mei's chamomile tea for that collaboration.\n\nPeter: Agreed! I can't wait to see how our projects complement each other. Looking forward to making more memories in our hometown with both the cat mural and the sunset music event.\n\nNoor: Definitely, Peter. It's wonderful to collaborate with like-minded individuals like you and Mei. And remember, I'll bring tea and headphones for our meeting tomorrow. Let's make this work!",

Leo agrees and suggests involving Mei and offering chamomile tea and custom lattles for Stray-13. They also discuss a surprise guest for the stray cat event and plan to further discuss details about the rhythm-based algorithm at Main Street Tacos the following morning. Both Leo and Peter express excitement about their growing creative partnership, feeling they have found a creative home with each other that is worth cherishing.",
