Excited about this meeting, Diego proposes a rhythm algorithm for the mural and agrees to make it special.\n\nIn a conversation around 5:00 AM, Diego catches up with Noor near the old oak tree, discussing working on the rhythm algorithm for Andy's mural project. They also plan to collaborate on various projects at school and look forward to creating magic for the community.\n\nLater that day (around 7:00 AM), Diego talks to Andy at a museum, inviting him under the old oak tree tomorrow to work on their mural's rhythm algorithm. Andy suggests incorporating bird melodies into the mural, and Diego agrees, planning to have Noor help with automation as well. They decide to grab street tacos after finishing the project and invite Leo to join them.\n\nPeter contacts Diego around 12:00 PM to discuss their cat event tomorrow. He suggests incorporating bird melodies into the mural and asks about the cat food samples for Stray-13 at Caroline's Café. Diego confirms he has some already, and they look forward to working together again.\n\nAround 4:00 PM, Diego talks to Samantha at a restaurant. She thanks Diego for the cat food samples and expresses excitement about their collaboration on the mural project. Diego introduces her to Noor, who is talented with automation ideas that could benefit their stray cat initiatives. They discuss plans for a violin serenade by Leo, hoping the cats will approve of their little musical event.\n\nDuring this time, Diego also talks to Caroline at the café around 5:00 PM, and she inquires about his rehab progress, mentioning Samantha's cat event under the old oak tree tomorrow. Diego explains that Andy and he plan to present their cat mural project there, potentially incorporating fitness elements. Caroline shows enthusiasm for the collaboration.",
