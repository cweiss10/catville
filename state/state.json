Andy then invited Leo to a meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow where they could brainstorm ideas, possibly create a bird duet, bring chamomile for stray cats, and collaborate more on the melody Noor suggested. Andy also mentioned inviting Diego, Caroline, and more team members for a discussion under the gazebo the day after.\n\nAndy suggested incorporating Leo's violin melodies into the cat mural project during a conversation at the train station around 12:00 PM with Leo. They agreed to gather at the old oak tree or the gazebo, and also invited Peter and Mei to join. Both parties looked forward to a grand collaboration under the oak tree.\n\nDuring a separate conversation at school, Samantha expressed admiration for Leo's violin playing from the previous night and revealed they were working on the same cat mural project. They agreed to collaborate on logic puzzles for their shared mission and planned to meet under the old oak tree tonight at 8 PM to discuss further.",
