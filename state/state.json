Later, at 3:00 AM, Andy spoke with Noor at the museum, planning to collaborate on mechanical birds and discussing the community garden. Both agreed to bring chamomile lattes, and Diego overheard them expressing his excitement about the gathering.\n\nAt 6:00 AM, due to an unforeseen change in their plans, Andy spoke with Samantha at the hospital. Despite the change, they discussed moving forward with their collaborative efforts for their artistic and musical gathering under the stars. Later in the day, at 7:00 PM, Andy spoke with Diego at the hospital. Diego proposed collaborating his mechanical bird project with Andy's mural project, suggesting it would be a perfect backdrop. Andy was thrilled by the idea and invited Diego to join his robotics project gathering which also includes Samantha, Peter, and Leo. Diego agreed and suggested they set up a taco bar after the event. Both looked forward to their creative evening together.",
