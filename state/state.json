The group plans to regroup under the old oak tree as previously planned.\n\nLater, around 9:00 PM, Andy talks to Mei at the museum. Mei shares her enthusiasm for her zine club and suggests they meet up at the community center the next day to finalize their plans for the mural. Mei proposes joining forces with Peter under the old oak tree at 10 AM to work on both projects. Andy agrees, bringing his thermos of tea, and Diego will share his sketches for the mechanical birds.

Do join us if you can!\n\nMei: Sounds delightful! I'll bring seeds for the project and some noise-cancelling headphones Samantha suggested for focus aids.

Now, I heard from Peter that you were discussing your archival stickers with Samantha?\n\nMei: That's correct! And it seems we have a common interest now—the cat mural project. Have you talked to Leo about our collaboration yet?\n\nCaroline: Not officially, but we plan to discuss the latte-inspired bird design this evening at the gathering under the oak tree. Do join us if you can!\n\nMei: Sounds delightful! I'll bring seeds for the project and some noise-cancelling headphones Samantha suggested for focus aids.

Noor seems pretty excited.\n\nDiego: Yes, I spoke with Noor last night. We're planning a walk to get chamomile seeds from Peter and practicing our duet under the old oak tree like old times. She appreciates my dedication to this project. Have you tried those street tacos I recommended?\n\nLeo: Not yet, but I heard they're fantastic! Once we finish rehearsing, maybe we can grab some lunch together and catch up on each other's projects. It'd be good to hear more about your knee injury too.\n\nDiego: Sounds like a plan, Leo.
