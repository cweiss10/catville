The group decides to meet early tomorrow at the park to work on the mechanical birds before their scheduled meetings later in the day.\n\nIn the meantime, Andy and Peter have conversations. Andy expresses interest in collaborating with his mechanical birds for the cat mural event, and Peter agrees, suggesting they bring their creations together under the oak tree the following day. Andy also inquires about involving Mei's botanical expertise, to which Peter responds that he plans to discuss it with her later that evening, believing it would be a fantastic addition to the project.",

Samantha arranges a jam session with Noor's students and a few friends, and Leo is excited about this collaboration.\n\nAt 3:00 PM, Leo talks to Caroline at the museum who offers an expansion of the cat mural project focusing on the mechanical birds. Leo agrees, bringing his violin and a kitten for the collaboration. He looks forward to making the town even more memorable. They plan to finalize details at the community garden that night.
