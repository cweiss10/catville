They discuss Diego's squirrel latte art idea for the cat mural, and he informs her about his collaboration with Mei. They plan to involve Noor's students in design discussions and agree to feed the stray cats that evening. Diego also invites Caroline to join him in Andy's musical performance, promising a special event for their town. They agree to meet up again at the library later.",
