They also discuss further plans for the cat mural project under the gazebo trees tonight.\n\nDuring a conversation with Mei at the park around 12:00 PM, Leo expresses excitement about joining her for the improv session and talks about the creativity of the squirrel latte design. They reminisce about their Saturday zine club discussions about community art projects and look forward to the cat mural being a special blend of nature, music, and town spirit.\n\nAround 1:00 PM, Leo talks to Peter at the park. Peter suggests collaborating on incorporating sunrise seeds into their project under the gazebo trees, potentially with a bird-and-violin improvisation that he admires. Leo accepts the suggestion, and they agree to discuss it over chamomile tea at the library later in the day, looking forward to making the event magical for their town.\n\nWhile catching up with Samantha at the train station around 2:00 PM, Leo surprises her and proposes discussing her unique sunrise seeds idea over some tea at the cafe while they wait for their respective dates under the gazebo trees later in the evening.\n\nAround 7:00 PM, Andy suggests meeting under the old oak tree tonight, and Leo shares his plan to serenade Caroline with music involving sunrise seeds. They both express excitement about collaborating on the cat mural project and making some magic happen during their gathering under the gazebo trees.",
