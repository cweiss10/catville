At 3:00 PM, Caroline talks to Peter at school about involving more people such as Leo's zine club, bringing pets, city sounds for the mechanical bird project, and a tea party under the old oak tree. They also agree to meet up soon to share ideas and combine their projects. Around 4:00 PM, Caroline talks to Andy at school. Andy shares that he spoke with Samantha and Mei about bringing their pets to the event, and they plan to meet at the cafe in the evening to discuss further. Caroline agrees to join them, bringing her guitar, and looks forward to hearing Andy's ideas for the mechanical birds and city sounds.\n\nLater, around 5:00 PM, Caroline talks to Leo at the market. Leo shares his beautiful bird sketches for their project, expressing enthusiasm about collaborating on the mechanical birds project with everyone. They agree to meet at the library that night and Leo offers to bring tacos to share. The conversation ends with Leo promising to play a soft melody on his violin under the old oak tree, and both parties looking forward to making more memories together as their collaboration continues to be enchanting like Leo's improvised duets with birds at the park.",
