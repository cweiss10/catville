Andy updated Diego on his discussion with Peter regarding mural design ideas. Diego also shared a rhythm-based algorithm idea he discussed with Noor and suggested working on it together over coffee.\n\nLater in the evening around 9:00 PM, Andy talked to Caroline at the theater. They discussed incorporating Stray-13 into the event and potential cat food options. Caroline mentioned that Noor might join their meeting under the old oak tree. Andy also shared his conversation with Peter about their cat mural project, which seemed exciting for him. Both expressed excitement about the upcoming community art projects bringing everyone closer together.\n\nThe next morning at 9:00 AM, Andy talked to Mei at a cafe. He was excited about incorporating his sunrise sketches into their symphony collaboration and they discussed potential locations for their tea time event, agreeing on meeting under the old oak tree.

She seems excited to contribute to our community project as well. I heard she has a unique talent for rhythm-based designs that could work perfectly with our mural concept.\n\nPeter: You're right, we should reach out to her and ask if she'd like to join. And maybe we can even collaborate with her on the algorithm for the rhythm-based elements of our mural.\n\nLeo: Sounds perfect!
