They have decided to collaborate on this community art project and plan to meet under an old oak tree early tomorrow morning, as well as tonight at a gazebo to discuss ideas further. Caroline suggested incorporating latte art at the cafe to reflect the mural, and hopes Leo can share some of his improvised melodies that would match perfectly with the mural. They aim to make this project something their town will truly cherish.",
