Your ideas always add a unique touch to our projects. I'm looking forward to that coffee meeting at Caroline's this week. And speaking of unique, I appreciate your kindness towards the neighborhood strays. It's a shared passion we can work on together in the mural design.\n\nSamantha: Yes, let's make sure to include them prominently. I'm excited about this collaboration and feeding them during our meetings sounds like a great bonding ritual. Let's coordinate our schedules for the upcoming events.",
