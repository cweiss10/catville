By the way, have you heard about Leo's idea of incorporating his amp into the mural?\n\nSamantha: Yes, he mentioned it when we talked at school. It could be an interesting addition, especially if we can find a way to make it blend seamlessly with the rest of the design. Maybe we can rehearse under the old oak tree once it's integrated?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! I think the bird duets under that tree would provide the perfect ambiance for our collaboration.
