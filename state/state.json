Caroline also mentioned a latte art brainstorming session with Mei later on.\n\nAt 2:00 PM, Leo spoke with Diego about mural plans and discussed improvisation tricks for Leo's headphones and a meeting with Noor later that day to discuss stretch routines and noise-cancelling headphones for practice sessions. They also made plans to meet under the old oak tree with Andy over the weekend to chat about mechanical bird ideas for the mural.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, Leo talked to Noor at the gym about the mural plans, sharing that they would both contribute elements from the old oak tree to the project. Noor also offered seeds for the community garden. Later in the day, Leo spoke with Diego at home around 9:00 PM, discussing bringing mechanical birds and street tacos to their mural rehearsal, recalling their old busking duets under the oak tree. Diego suggested checking out improvisation tricks Samantha showed Leo for the bird melodies. Both agreed to keep each other updated as they worked on different aspects of the project.",

What about you? Anything new with your melodies?\n\nLeo: Yes, I've been improvising with bird songs lately. Let's give it a try and see if they blend well with the mural theme. I also invited Diego's robotics club to help with sound systems and noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nAndy: That sounds brilliant! I brought cat food for Stray-13 as well. How about we meet at Caroline's Café tomorrow to share ideas, music, and maybe teach each other a thing or two?\n\nLeo: Great idea, Andy!
