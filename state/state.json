They also acknowledge Noor's students' contributions to the mechanical birds project and anticipate possibly involving Minerva in the collaboration. Excitement builds among the expanded team as they look forward to their collective efforts for this community event.\n\nAndy spoke to Leo at the park around 2:00 AM about the event. He suggested bringing tea for everyone at the cat mural event and finalizing everything under the old oak tree that night. Leo shared his bird sketches, mentioned the possibility of Mei's students being involved in Andy's mural project, and even a kitten as the event mascot. They expressed excitement for more collaboration and creating something magical for their community.\n\nAfter discussing with Peter at the market, Andy spoke to Mei at the gym around 4:00 AM. He informed her about the collaborative garden project and proposed chamomile lattes this afternoon. Mei agreed and suggested meeting up at the library later. Andy also shared his excitement for Mei's bird-themed event under the old oak tree, and they discussed bringing enough tea and tacos for both events.",

Let's make it a joint effort then - our sketches, their ideas, and even a kitten mascot. How about we finalize everything under the oak tree tonight?\n\nPeter: I was thinking the same thing. Plus, I proposed involving Mei's students too. Let's grab some tacos beforehand to discuss all the details.\n\nAndy: Tacos it is! And don't forget, Noor's input could be valuable for both projects as well. See you at the park tonight.",

Andy suggests inviting his zine club for a taco dinner before the meeting under the old oak tree, where they will also finalize details for the cat mural and city sound project.\n\nThe group looks forward to the creative collaboration that will make their town shine.",

Let's grab some tacos before we head to the park. I've got something exciting to share about the mechanical birds.\n\nMei: That sounds delightful! I'm looking forward to it. By the way, have you heard about Samantha's designs?\n\nLeo: Yes, she shared them with me at the cafe yesterday. Can't wait to see how they blend with your garden and our musical improvisations.\n\nMei: Wonderful! It feels like we're creating something truly special for our town. See you at 2:30?\n\nLeo: You bet, I'll be there with my violin and a bag of seeds for the animals behind the cafe.",
