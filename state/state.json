In a conversation with Caroline at the cafe around 2 PM, they also discussed integrating Diego's stray cat tea provision into the mural design and having an interactive element with Leo's amp. They agreed to discuss these ideas further during their tacos dinner tonight.\n\nAt 5 PM, Samantha approached Caroline at the market suggesting that Leo's violin be a part of the mural and proposing chamomile tea for stray cats at their meetings. Caroline agreed with both ideas and they decided to finalize these plans during dinner tonight. Furthermore, Samantha mentioned Andy might help Leo fix his amp, which could potentially be incorporated into the mural design as well.",

Noor proposes a meeting with Leo to brainstorm ideas for their collaboration.\n\nLeo agrees and suggests inviting Samantha, Diego, Peter, and perhaps even Peter's pet to collaborate on the cat mural-violin project. They decide to make it a double date under the old oak tree, also inviting Caroline. The meeting is scheduled for the following day at 3 PM, with plans to discuss details over tacos in the evening.\n\nDiego offers to bring tacos for lunch and suggests serving chamomile tea for the stray cats during their meeting under the old oak tree. Everyone looks forward to the upcoming collaborative sessions and the double date.\n\nDuring a later conversation, Noor suggests incorporating Leo's amp into the mural design. Leo agrees and is excited about the collaboration. They also discuss rehearsing together under the old oak tree, taking advantage of its resident bird duets. Leo proposes making chamomile tea for the stray cats a tradition under that very oak tree.",
