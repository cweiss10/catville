At 12:00 PM, while at school, he spoke with Peter about their cat mural and mechanical bird projects and planned a collaboration between Peter and Samantha on the latter. They confirmed meeting under an oak tree later that day and agreed on taco night.\n\nPeter then suggested involving Leo in his own mural garden project and mentioned that Caroline might have bird sketches for it. Earlier, Leo had talked with Caroline at the museum who was excited about collaborating on their projects. At 12:00 AM, Peter and Leo met at a restaurant where they further discussed their projects, including an impromptu violin duet with the birds that Noor and Leo had come up with.\n\nAt around 2:00 AM, Leo talked to Noor at the town hall, who was excited about their upcoming meeting under the oak tree to discuss the blending of Leo's violin and mechanical birds with Noor's tacos. They agreed to make it an extraordinary collaboration and confirmed meeting at 5:00 PM.\n\nLater at 6:00 PM, Leo talked to Diego at the library about their conversations regarding mechanical birds going well. Mei was on board for the planning session under the oak tree tomorrow, and suggested unique gardening ideas. Diego plans a chamomile tea for their meeting as per tradition and suggests grabbing traditional lattes with fresh mint afterward. Leo agrees, suggesting they make it a night to remember at his favorite taco spot, marking a wonderful way to seal their collaborative deal.\n\nAt 8:00 PM, Leo talked to Mei at the hospital. She brought seeds for their mural ideas and Leo had sketches for their latte art collaboration. They agreed to discuss these over street tacos later and also decided to stretch before their meeting under the oak tree tomorrow, valuing community in their projects and finding this added refreshing touch.",
