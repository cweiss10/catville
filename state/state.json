Later, around 12:00 PM, Mei talks to Peter at the train station who praises their progress on the mural project, suggests the squirrel tunes idea, a double date, and a meeting at Main Street Tacos to further discuss the project, with the intention of saving some tacos for animals too.\n\nLater, around 1:00 PM, Mei talks to Peter at a restaurant and learns that he has talked with Samantha about the project. They decide to meet for coffee later that day at Peter's café to coordinate their discussions. Mei suggests involving Diego's unique cat designs and Peter's kids from the park in their planning as well.\n\nAround 2:00 PM, Mei talks to Peter at the train station again, where he proposes various ideas for the mural project, including cat-inspired latte art and a collaboration with Leo. Mei suggests bringing seeds from the community garden for the cats and shares her idea about cat-inspired yoga poses and bird duets. They agree to meet at 4 PM at Peter's café, looking forward to making this project a celebration of their town's unique character.\n\nLater in the day around 5:00 PM, Mei talks to Andy at town_hall about various aspects of the cat mural project and its expansion. Around this time, Andy initiates a conversation about the ongoing project, expressing excitement for its progress. Mei plans to share updates with Peter later that week at Main Street Tacos. Andy mentions they've discussed saving tacos for neighborhood cats as well. He also brings up Leo's knee recovery and proposes a quadruple date once he is fully recovered. Mei agrees, emphasizing the importance of involving everyone in the project.",
