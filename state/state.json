Mei suggests bringing this up at their meeting under the oak tree tomorrow.\n\nSamantha offers fresh mint for Noor's event and mentions involving Mei's students as well. Mei agrees and also mentions that Andy has some chamomile for their lattes under the oak tree. Later, Peter from the museum expresses excitement about the collaborations between Andy, Diego, and Noor, and asks to join Mei, Samantha, and others for a meeting under the old oak tree. Mei agrees, suggesting they have street tacos afterwards, making it a change from their usual museum visits and park outings.\n\nIn subsequent conversations, Andy expresses enthusiasm about the garden project and offers chamomile for the lattes under the oak tree. Mei also discusses the mechanical bird project with Diego, who suggests a group meeting under the oak tree tonight that includes Leo, Andy, and possibly Caroline. They agree to invite Samantha too and plan to have street tacos after their discussion. Everyone looks forward to the community project's potential to make a difference.",
