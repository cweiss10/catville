They finalize plans for the cat mural and discuss involving Leo in their Saturday zine club and introducing him to their community garden.\n\nLater on, Caroline talks to Noor at the town hall around 1:00 AM, expressing enthusiasm about making this project special for their town. They plan a little tea party with street tacos after their meetings under the old oak tree, and discuss involving Leo in their zine club and community garden, as well as incorporating Diego's kitten into their plans.\n\nDuring the meeting under the old oak tree, they brainstorm ideas for the cat mural, including Diego's mechanical bird design and Leo's latte bird design. They are excited to bring these ideas together to contribute to the town's creative scene.\n\nCaroline later talks to Peter at a hospital around 8:00 AM about involving his robotics skills in their mural project. Peter agrees, and mentions Diego will also bring street tacos. Caroline suggests a coffee catch-up with Peter, Diego, and others later that day.\n\nLater in the day, Caroline talks to Peter again at the gym around 11:00 AM about the progress of their cat mural project and Peter's discussions with Diego. They also discuss Noor joining them under the old oak tree and plan a latte art discussion after their meeting.",
