Exciting times!\n\nDiego: Absolutely! It sounds like things are really coming together. By the way, I talked to Leo earlier, and he promised to fix those amps by tonight. We should be all set for our performance at Main Street Tacos.\n\nCaroline: Perfect timing! See you there then. Maybe we can convince him to throw in some bird improvisations too. And don't forget about your warm-up before our morning run on Thursday, as Noor suggested.\n\nDiego: You got it. I'll see you at the tacos tonight, and we can discuss more details over dinner.
