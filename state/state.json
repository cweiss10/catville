Let's invite Diego to join us too - I know he'd love the opportunity to share his latte art ideas.\n\nAndy: Definitely! And don't forget, we should discuss the stray cats as well since Noor suggested bringing some food for them at the park.\n\nMei: Of course, I already spoke with Caroline about that. She's on board with inviting Samantha and using Diego's watering skills for our cat mural project.\n\nAndy: That's fantastic! We really are creating something special here, Mei. I can't wait to see what we come up with together.\n\nMei: Agreed, Andy. I feel it'll be a wonderful collaboration that will make our community stronger. Let's meet at the café later tonight for some chamomile tea and discuss everything in detail before tomorrow's meeting under the oak tree.",
