Samantha brought that up during our yoga studio discussion. She even suggested a quadruple date with Andy, remember?\n\nNoor: Oh right, she did! So we're all set for Thursday at Main Street Tacos then? And don't forget about the cat feeding at Caroline's Café this week.\n\nDiego: Exactly! I can't wait to join you guys once my knee recovers. Mei is already thrilled about it. How did your chat with Samantha go at the train station?\n\nNoor: We agreed to catch up next week at Caroline's Café and work on routines together, bringing headphones along for better focus.
