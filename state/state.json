They also agreed to collaborate on the cat mural project. Around 10:00 AM at school, she talked with Peter who shared his plans to incorporate sunrise seeds into the squirrel latte design at the gazebo event and suggested gathering stray cats for both events and helping with the chamomile tea. In response, Caroline proposed an improv singing session under the gazebo after dinner.\n\nAt around 11:00 AM at the train station, she had another conversation with Andy regarding their plans. Andy suggested a cheetah sculpture for their cat mural project and discussed the squirrel latte contest at Main Street Tacos. Caroline agreed to invite everyone for a dinner catch-up before the contest.\n\nTalked to Noor at park around 12:00 PM, Caroline announced that Leo would be joining with an impromptu music number for their improv night under the gazebo. Noor suggested a symphony performance on the old oak tree and proposed involving Diego for pre-performance stretches and tacos at Main Street Tacos. They agreed to gather everyone together and make it a memorable evening, just like their recent cat mural project.",
