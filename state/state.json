They agreed that incorporating bird-themed zines and city sounds were brilliant ideas. Andy also mentioned Noor's melodies under the old oak tree and Caroline's latte-art day, with Samantha suggesting using Noor's kitten as a mascot for their event.\n\nSamantha promised to bring up the mural garden plans with Peter during their lunch meeting the following day, hoping that Leo would also bring his melodies and latte art to the event. Andy spoke with Diego at the train station around 6:00 PM about the cat mural and the community event under the old oak tree, discussing potential collaborations with Leo's bird sketches. They discussed their individual meetings regarding the mechanical birds project and solo gallery show respectively, and agreed on bringing pets to post-event gatherings to encourage more community involvement.",

Later, around 11 AM, Samantha invites Noor's students to join them under the oak tree the following day. Noor suggests her students might bring science projects that could interest Leo in incorporating them into his mechanical birds. They plan to catch up more at Andy's tea party and discuss having tacos together before the gathering.\n\nDuring this conversation, Samantha runs into Diego at the hospital around 12:00 PM. He inquires about the mural garden progress and is updated on Leo's bird sketches. Diego offers chamomile tea and invites Samantha to join him under the old oak tree for further discussion, bringing his kitten Minerva along for inspiration. Samantha accepts the invitation and suggests bringing Leo for a more productive collaboration session before their next gathering.",
