Andy has planned a meeting tonight at Main Street Tacos for the project discussion, a coffee meeting with Peter and Diego under the old oak tree tomorrow, and a sunrise seeds exchange as part of a double date which involves Caroline.\n\nAndy spoke with Peter at home around 7:00 AM, discussing finalizing details for the cat mural project over tacos tonight and Leo's improvised symphony idea under the old oak tree. They also touched base about a potential fitness collaboration, which Diego had expressed enthusiasm for after their conversation at the museum earlier today.\n\nLater in the day, Andy contacted Mei to inform her that Diego is on board with the project. Mei suggested meeting under the gazebo tomorrow afternoon to finalize designs and collaborations, bringing chamomile tea for stray cats as per Caroline's suggestion. They also discussed a sunrise seeds exchange during their get-together, which seems to be part of a double date.\n\nIn addition to this, Andy spoke with Peter at the library around 6:00 PM, where he inquired about Peter's recent interest in sunrise seeds. Peter proposed an improvised symphony under the old oak tree tonight and mentioned their upcoming fitness collaboration, asking Andy for some gym tips for his knee. They agreed to discuss these matters further.\n\nSamantha was contacted at the hospital around 8:00 PM, but no specifics about the conversation were provided in the lines of conversation. It's later revealed that Samantha spoke with Mei and Leo today about the cat mural project, and they are all meeting this evening for brainstorming sessions. Andy, Peter, and Caroline are excited about it, and Diego has been invited to join under the old oak tree tonight due to his musical ideas. They plan to make the mural something special.",
