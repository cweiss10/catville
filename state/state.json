They discussed collaborating on a unique project for the cat mural, and agreed to meet at a café the next day for discussion over chamomile tea for stray cats. Leo suggested incorporating his improvised instruments into Andy's mural plans.\n\nAt 8:00 AM, Samantha met with Leo in the park where she shared that she had found an old violin for their project. They expressed excitement about the musical sunrise event and the cat mural collaboration. Leo invited her to a café meeting the next day and looked forward to seeing how everything unfolded.\n\nAt 10:00 AM, Diego from the museum discussed his idea for their performance at the oak tree – incorporating his footwork into the mix. Leo agreed, and they both expressed excitement about collaborating on this new layer to their sunrise symphony, with Diego sharing that it helps keep his mind off his knee issues.
