At 12:00 PM, Andy talked to Diego at the cafe about their mural project, with Andy expressing appreciation for Diego's insights from their previous conversation at the hospital. They agreed to coordinate schedules for quiet coffee chats and set a meeting under the old oak tree the next day at 5:30 PM. Diego promised to bring street tacos, and they discussed setting up quiet corners near the cat mural. Additionally, Andy mentioned they'd spoken to Caroline and Peter, who were eager to collaborate, and reminded Diego about taking care of stray animals before their meeting. They ended the conversation with a mutual agreement to support each other during the project and looking forward to seeing each other under the oak tree.",

With Leo's musical input and the robotics club's expertise, they aim to create something special for Caroline's open mic night.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, Diego spoke with Andy at a cafe about their collaboration on the mechanical bird project. They expressed excitement for the project and discussed the positive impact of teamwork. Andy appreciated Diego's suggestion to involve Caroline in the mural project.\n\nDiego later talked to Caroline at the library around 4:00 AM, discussing plans for their mechanical bird project performance at the park under the oak tree, including a street taco rhythm and potential sound quality improvements with Peter.
