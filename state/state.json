They also plan to involve Leo in a double date, and Caroline's latte art skills.\n\nLater, Leo suggests tacos for their collaboration dinner and invites Noor and Peter. In response, Noor proposes Leo's performance under the oak tree for their sunrise symphony project. They also discuss involving Andy's latte art magic to create something extraordinary.\n\nCaroline later talks to Noor at the gym and suggests practicing under the old oak tree with everyone involved in the cat mural project. She proposes including sunrise seeds in the design to capture the early morning ambiance, and they plan to have treats for the stray cats as well. They decide to meet under the oak tree at 3:00 PM.",
