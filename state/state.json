Later in the day, Noor has a conversation with Caroline at the library where Caroline suggests using an old oak tree in the park as a canvas for the mural, inviting Noor to collaborate with Diego's robotics club and incorporating squirrel latte art during their community celebration.\n\nIn the early hours of the next day, Noor communicates with Samantha about the cat mural project. They discuss Samantha bringing her violin, lab equipment, laptop, and headphones for their meeting under the gazebo trees. Noor also mentions that she has brought extra equipment and that Diego is making street tacos for everyone. Samantha agrees to bring snacks as well, and they look forward to the musical collaboration between Samantha's violin and Diego's robotic creation. The two plan to make this a memorable day for their town.",
