They also agreed to meet under the old oak tree later that afternoon at 3:00 PM for more discussions on the project and watering systems with Noor.\n\nAt around 11:00 AM, Caroline spoke to Samantha at the library. She appreciated the heads-up about the project and brought noise-cancelling headphones as requested. Caroline shared her excitement about Leo's performance under the old oak tree and Diego's bird melodies. Samantha suggested they bring tacos for energy during their session.\n\nCaroline informed Samantha that she had not yet heard from Diego about his violin melodies but spoke with him earlier in the day. She promised to text any updates. They agreed to hope for good weather and discussed making the project a success, rain or shine. The conversation ended with both looking forward to seeing each other under the old oak tree the next day.",
