Peter told me about your suggestion involving kids in our mural project, and I can't wait to hear more about it. Let's make sure we discuss that too, as well as Leo's improvised violin performance.\n\nMei: Sounds great, Andy. Let's also collaborate on squirrel latte art designs with Peter for our gallery show—I think his talents will really add to the exhibition.
