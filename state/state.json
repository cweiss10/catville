Noor seems pretty excited.\n\nDiego: Yes, I spoke with Noor last night. We're planning a walk to get chamomile seeds from Peter and practicing our duet under the old oak tree like old times. She appreciates my dedication to this project. Have you tried those street tacos I recommended?\n\nLeo: Not yet, but I heard they're fantastic! Once we finish rehearsing, maybe we can grab some lunch together and catch up on each other's projects. It'd be good to hear more about your knee injury too.\n\nDiego: Sounds like a plan, Leo.
