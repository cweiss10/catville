Later in the night, around 10:00 PM, Mei encountered Leo at a cafe where they talked about Leo's busking experience and the mural project. Leo shared his interest in being part of it, suggesting a meeting under the old oak tree the next day. They also discussed plans to discuss details over tacos and lattes and Leo possibly performing a tune for Mei during their meeting.\n\nAround 11:00 PM, Mei talked to Peter at the market who suggested that Diego's robotics ideas could be beneficial for the project. Mei agreed and mentioned speaking to him about his mechanical birds concept earlier. They also discussed inviting Leo, Samantha, Noor's robotics club, and possibly Peter himself to join under the old oak tree tomorrow.\n\nFinally, around 12:00 AM, Mei talked to Caroline at a restaurant where they expressed excitement about involving the community in their project and making their town proud. The cat mural project is progressing with various collaborations and growing interest from the community members.",
