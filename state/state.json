They also agreed to have a quadruple date tonight before starting their creative session under the gazebo trees tomorrow. Caroline mentioned Leo bringing his violin and Noor promised to bring treats for the stray cats as well.\n\nCaroline talked to Diego at home around 12:00 PM, where they discussed the cat mural project in more detail. Diego agreed to participate and suggested a double date with Mei and Noor for their quadruple date tonight. They decided to update each other on their progress later today at the park during their pre-gazebo stretch session. Caroline expressed her excitement for tomorrow's special day.",
