Peter also shared that he and Mei were discussing ways to care for stray cats in the community, suggesting they gather them under the old oak tree before dinner that night.\n\nAt the museum around 12:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Leo about the gazebo serenade and the cat mural project. They discussed incorporating sunrise seeds into the squirrel latte designs and how Samantha's sketches would help bring it all together. Both agreed on collaborating with her that night to ensure the stray cats also received a memorable experience in their community.\n\nAt 3:00 PM, Caroline talked to Mei at the theater about incorporating sunrise seeds into the squirrel latte designs and discussed the details of their meeting at Main Street Tacos. Mei confirmed she would bring some seeds for the project. Later at 4:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Diego at the museum who was excited for the cat mural project and the quadruple date organized by Caroline. He also mentioned his run that day and they discussed looking forward to their meeting under the gazebo.",
