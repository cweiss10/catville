They also plan to integrate star constellation ideas from Diego into the mural, meet at a cafe, share sketches, possibly run together, collaborate with Peter, and aspire for an interactive exhibit with Samantha's programming skills.\n\nIn later conversations around 12:00 AM with Samantha at home, Andy invites her to join the project, and they discuss incorporating star constellations and using noise-cancelling headphones in the design. They plan to meet under the old oak tree at 6:30 AM for a run, discuss shared ideas for the mural as well as logic puzzles, possibly collaborate with Peter, and aspire for an interactive exhibit with Samantha's programming skills.\n\nIn new conversations around 1:00 AM with Diego at a train station, Andy suggests Mei and Samantha join the morning run, and they agree to grab street tacos afterward. They also discuss bringing Peter on board, creating something unique for the cat mural project, and sharing chamomile tea for stray cats. Diego agrees to their plans and proposes a double date with Mei.\n\nIn further conversations around 6:00 AM at a park, Andy invites Peter to join forces for the cat mural project, suggesting that his bird duet idea could blend well with Diego's star constellation theme. Peter accepts and suggests bringing chamomile tea for stray cats. Diego agrees to provide street tacos for their team get-togethers and looks forward to a double date with Mei. They confirm their plans for the morning run under the old oak tree.\n\nIn conversations at 7:00 AM, Andy talks to Samantha at a restaurant where they discuss incorporating her bird duet into the cat mural project. Samantha agrees and plans to bring her violin to their meeting under the old oak tree the next day. They also remind each other about Diego's street tacos after their meeting, anticipating a creative gathering.\n\nIn conversations at 9:00 AM, Andy talks to Mei at school where they coordinate details for their morning run and discuss meeting at the library first for some sunrise seeds and a quick stretch. They also agree to set out chamomile tea for stray kitties, plan their double date later, and look forward to catching up more then.",
