Reminding everyone not to forget about feeding the stray cats on Sunday, the conversation progresses.\n\nAt 10 PM, Peter talks to Caroline at school. She proposes that Mei, Noor, and Diego also collaborate on the cat mural project. They decide to incorporate some music into their events, like the mini bird duet mentioned earlier. Peter also proposes getting together at the park again soon and celebrating once they finish the cat mural with tacos on Main Street.\n\nAt 11 PM, Andy talks to Peter at a cafe. Andy appreciates Peter's contribution of the violins to their cat mural design and mentions his admiration for the work Andy has been doing at the community center. Andy suggests involving the children from the community center more in their project and plans to discuss this further during their quadruple date.\n\nAround 2 AM, Peter talks to Andy at home about a new idea for their cat mural - a day dedicated to feeding stray cats under a gazebo while planning and bonding. Peter agrees to bring the sunrise seeds and mentions a hospital piece with Samantha.\n\nAt 5 AM, Peter talks to Samantha at the hospital. She updates him on plans for a squirrel latte contest with Mei and invites him for brainstorming sessions, suggesting Main Street Tacos for dinner tomorrow. Peter proposes coordinating their meeting with Leo's suggested time at Main Street Tacos and bringing noise-cancelling headphones for focus. Samantha agrees and suggests that Leo's violin could add charm under the gazebo trees. The group is looking forward to a productive and creative gathering.",

Later, at the park around 3:00 PM, Leo spoke to Peter about playing a violin under the gazebo trees, proposing a duet with the birds and potentially Caroline. Peter suggested involving Noor and Andy in the cat mural project as well. Both agreed that the project was taking shape and looked forward to making music and bringing the cats together to create something extraordinary. At the gazebo around 4:00 PM, Leo and Peter reflected on their past busking sessions and reminisced about their start at the cat mural project with Sunrise Seeds. They planned to make a memorable show for the public under the trees, complete with noise-cancelling headphones and snacks. Leo also brought his violin for a possible bird duet with Caroline, as they prepared to kickstart their collaborative efforts on the project.",
