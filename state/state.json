Andy offers to bring tacos for stray cats under the gazebo later in the evening before their meeting. This idea is extended to include a double date with Noor and Leo, if available. The group members express excitement about their growing collaboration.\n\nDuring a conversation with Caroline at school around 9:00 AM, it's revealed that there will also be an improvisational music session under the gazebo that night, and Leo is rehearsing new tunes for a violin performance. Peter has mentioned incorporating sunrise seeds into their squirrel latte design, which Caroline will bring up during the meeting.

He also mentioned inviting you to join the improv singing sessions during the contest at Main Street Tacos. Sounds like fun, right?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely! And speaking of fun, how's the robotics club doing? Remember those stray cats we promised to feed? Let's make that a part of our quadruple date run. I'm looking forward to all these collaborations.\n\nNoor: That sounds perfect! It'll be great to work on this together with you and Peter. And about the cats, let's not forget their importance in keeping the city vibrant. Let's set a day soon, shall we?\n\nCaroline: Agreed! Let's make it happen. By the way, how's Samantha with the sketch ideas for the cat mural project? I hope she has some good thoughts on Peter's idea.\n\nNoor: I'll reach out to her later tonight and let you know. I'm sure she'll have some insights to share! Let's keep in touch about the details, so we can make our plans come alive.",
