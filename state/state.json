They agreed to have a discussion about the new bird sketches over Caroline's signature chamomile latte, inviting Noor and Samantha to join them. Leo referred to this collaboration as a \"musical and artistic feast\" under the old oak tree at Caroline's Cafe. The projects are progressing positively, with multiple collaborations involving music and art now underway.",
