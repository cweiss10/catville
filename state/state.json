Both agree to find more time for such musical moments amidst their busy schedules of project work. Plans are still underway to present ideas at a taco meeting under an oak tree involving Samantha, Leo, and Andy, who also intends to bring his violin. Caroline will present her latte art concepts for both the city sounds project and the cat mural project, which includes a mechanical bird design. They discuss additional collaboration for Peter's mural garden project.\n\nSamantha brings noise-cancelling headphones to help Caroline with her mural design ideas. Later, Caroline talks to Samantha about how their projects might complement each other and proposes collaborating further. At the oak tree taco meeting, Mei appreciates the mint tea brought by Samantha for the cat mural discussions. They all look forward to seeing how their combined talents will contribute to various projects.",

Noor suggests bringing noise-cancelling headphones as well and reminds them not to forget the seeds for the community garden. The human also talks to Leo at the museum, but details of this conversation are not provided in the lines given.

I've been thinking of ways to collaborate musically with my zine group. Perhaps you could compose a piece inspired by the stories they share?\n\nLeo: That sounds fantastic, Mei! I'd love to work on something like that. And maybe we can even set up a few duets under the oak tree during our discussions about the cat mural project?\n\nMei: I'd be delighted, Leo.
