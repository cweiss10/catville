They plan to further discuss at Main Street Tacos tomorrow as planned, which will also be attended by Mei. Andy confirms his rehearsal with Caroline at the theater before the community celebration at the gazebo tomorrow morning and suggests a coffee catch-up and sketching out ideas for their bird duet.\n\nToday, Andy also talks to Samantha around 4:00 AM about the mural project and collaborates on the bird duet details for their meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow. They discuss integrating robotics into the tree project as well. Samantha thanks Andy for sunrise seeds that he plans to plant under the gazebo trees.\n\nAndy talks to Peter at a restaurant around 8:00 AM and invites Diego to their meeting tomorrow, who's expected to elevate their tree design with his robotic ideas. They agree to squeeze in a quick workout before their meeting and decide to meet at the park near the playground at 9:00 AM. Peter assures Andy that his work always speaks for itself and encourages him, looking forward to rocking the project together.\n\nIn addition, Andy talks to Mei at gym around 10:00 AM, planning to meet at Main Street Tacos tomorrow to discuss their bird duet for the mural project. They also plan to discuss cat food for strays and catching up over gym sessions before Saturday, just like old times.",
