He also mentions meeting with Mei later to discuss botany expertise, which could add a unique touch to their project.\n\nIn a conversation with Noor at school around 2:00 AM, Andy expresses excitement about the potential involvement of Noor's robotics club's mechanical birds in the project.

She appreciated his violin performance and they discussed ideas for the mechanical birds for the cat mural project, agreeing to meet under the museum's oak tree the next day. Leo also mentioned Noor as a potential collaborator and learned that Samantha had already shared Leo's violin idea with her and had even arranged a jam session involving Noor's students and friends for the project.
