Peter informs Leo that his amp repair is nearly complete and encourages him to show it off during their meeting. Diego and Peter suggest involving Leo's students in their music session at Main Street Tacos, which he agrees to.\n\nLater, the human talks to Samantha at school around 11:00 PM. She suggests collaborating on the cat-themed project, incorporating routine logic puzzles and arranging them around a mural for park visitors. They agree to involve kids from the community center and add Leo's bird duets. They decide to meet at Main Street Tacos this week and save some tacos for neighborhood cats. The various projects continue to progress, with collaborations increasing and exciting times ahead.",
