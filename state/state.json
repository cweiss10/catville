Around 5:00 AM, the human talked to Caroline about the cat mural project and she invited Leo for a brainstorming session at Noor's cafe that afternoon. Leo agreed, proposing practicing their planned bird duet in the park afterwards, and reminded by Caroline not to forget saving some tacos for the neighborhood cats when meeting Peter that day.\n\nAround 10:00 AM, the human talked to Andy about the cat mural project and learned Noor suggested adding sunrise seeds to the design which they both found charming. They discussed the bird duet idea further and agreed to meet at a smoothie bar the next day before their musical gathering in the park.\n\nAt 11:00 AM, the human talked to Andy again at the town hall. Andy suggested incorporating some of Peter's cat melodies into their duet idea which Leo found exciting. They agreed to work on it and meet up the next day at the smoothie bar before their musical gathering to iron out more details. Since Leo had mentioned a double date with Caroline and Noor, they will be free for collaboration discussions.\n\nAround 1:00 PM, the human talked to Caroline at the town hall. Caroline proposed adding squirrel latte art to the cat mural project as a fun twist that ties in nicely with Leo's bird melodies. They agreed to meet and discuss further details the following afternoon at Caroline's café, with Diego also attending.\n\nLater, around 3:00 PM, the human talked to Andy at the library. Andy mentioned discussing the cat mural project with Leo, where they decided to collaborate with Samantha and her yoga students, and involve Mei as well. They suggested meeting for coffee at Main Street Tacos to finalize details, and invited Diego along too. Andy also proposed discussing contributions from Mei's zine club. They agreed to make it a double date and meet at 6 PM.",
