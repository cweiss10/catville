He seemed interested too, we're meeting next week.\n\nLeo: That sounds exciting! Maybe you could include my music in your gym too, like background ambiance or something?\n\nPeter: Haha, I think that might be pushing it, but I'll see what I can do! You should come by and check it out sometime.\n\nLeo: I'd love to, Peter. Let's catch up soon over some coffee at the library.
