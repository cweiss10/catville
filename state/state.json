They confirmed meeting under an oak tree later that day and agreed on taco night.\n\nAt 1:00 AM, Leo talked to Peter again who mentioned that Noor stopped by earlier and seemed excited about their project. They discussed bringing noise-cancelling headphones for their meeting and agreed to continue with the chamomile lattes and street tacos afterward. Peter expressed his excitement about the collaboration potentially bringing them closer together. Leo reciprocated, expressing optimism about it being something amazing and a new adventure in art and friendship.\n\nBetween 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM, Leo talked to Caroline at the hospital. They discussed finding more time for impromptu duets with her latte art complementing his violin playing. They agreed to keep some time for music amidst all the collaborations, looking forward to making beautiful melodies together.",
