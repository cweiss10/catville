They plan to meet at the community garden that night and discuss details for the collaboration.\n\nAt 6:00 PM, Peter suggests including Leo's bird duets in their cat mural project and inviting his kitten to meetings. Leo agrees and proposes finalizing details for the city night-inspired tune the following day at the park. Peter also brings up chamomile lattes, which Leo confirms has already been discussed with Mei, who is excited to see Diego's mechanical bird ideas at the zine club rehearsal. The group plans to make their project something special.\n\nIn the evening around 8:00 PM, Diego and Leo catch up over dinner, discussing Leo's recent bird improvisation. Later, around 10:00 PM, Leo talks to Mei, who shares the excitement of involving his robotics club students in the cat mural project and planning a collaborative potluck under the old oak tree.
