And don't forget, we need to feed the cats on Saturday.\n\nMei: Absolutely, Peter. I'll remind Leo as well. Looking forward to our dinner and working together on this project.

They agree to have a quadruple date there early, bringing street tacos for the neighborhood cats as well. The human and Samantha plan to meet again tomorrow for their scheduled activities.\n\nAt 5:00 AM, the human talks with Peter at the museum about their bird duet project, which will be part of the cat mural, science club performance, and possibly a squirrel latte art event at Main Street Tacos. They also discuss a quadruple date this weekend and plan to practice the bird duet during their time together, potentially under the old oak tree where they first met.\n\nLater at 6:00 AM, Samantha informs Leo she picked up the sunrise seeds for their mural project as discussed with Noor at the market. They make plans to meet tomorrow for lunch and discuss Diego's squirrel latte art moves. Leo also suggests practicing their bird duets at Main Street Tacos after a show tonight, inviting Samantha to join if she is free. She might drop by but needs to wrap up work first, expressing eagerness to hear Leo's new piece 'Canon in D'.",
