Caroline joins them, discussing her work on the library event and looks forward to brainstorming more over tacos.\n\nLater, around 9:00 PM, Caroline talks to Noor at the park, discussing Diego's chamomile tea experiment for their mural project, his latte art, bringing cat seeds for Noor's part of the mural, and planning a surprise cat food for Stray-13 during their meeting the next day at the cafe. They all look forward to making the collaboration unforgettable.",
