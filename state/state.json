Leo also invited Samantha to join them for lunch beforehand. Noor, a school friend of Leo's, was excited about the collaboration and suggested joining Samantha for street tacos beforehand. Later in the day, Mei discussed with Leo the idea of having a mini-zine corner at their community event.\n\nThe anticipation for this collaboration was as exhilarating as one of the quiet park mornings with Leo's violin serenade. The group would also be joined by mechanical bird melodies and Diego's kitten, making it an adorable and creative gathering under the old oak tree.",
