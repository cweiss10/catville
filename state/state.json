During their conversation, Andy invites Leo for help in fixing an amp he inherited from his grandpa, which could potentially be incorporated into the mural design.\n\nIn additional conversations, Andy talks to Leo at town hall around 10:00 AM where Leo agrees to join them with his violin under the old oak tree. Andy also invites Peter and Noor for a double date. Later on, Andy talks to Caroline at home around 12:00 PM who reminds him of the chamomile tea and informs him that Samantha has agreed to bring sunrise seeds for the brainstorming session. They decide to invite Peter, Noor, Leo, Mei, and Diego to join their meeting.\n\nCaroline suggests noise-cancelling headphones in case things get loud during their collaborative session. After the meeting, they plan to have a performance with Leo's violin and discuss having dinner at Main Street Tacos after the meeting to make it a night to remember. They confirm their plans for the next day under the old oak tree.",
