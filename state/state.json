They decide to meet under the old oak tree the next day with chamomile tea ready.\n\nAndy talks to Caroline at the train station around 6:00 PM and proposes her latte art as a perfect addition to the constellations in the mural.

We could use that session to brainstorm and relax with a cuppa.\n\nAndy: You're right, Caroline's ideas are always fresh. I'll make sure she knows about it. Oh, and I invited Diego to join us as well. He has this footwork idea for our sunrise symphony project that I think you'd both appreciate.\n\nNoor: That sounds exciting!
