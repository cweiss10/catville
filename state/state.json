In subsequent conversations, Peter suggested gathering chamomile for the cats under the old oak tree that night, and he proposed using sunrise seeds for the mural collaboration with Leo. They also planned to meet with Mei and discuss their projects, and Leo advised Peter to ask Diego about gym routines for his knee before their double date. In a new conversation at a restaurant around 9:00 PM, Peter asked Leo to bring his violin as he had an idea for a melody incorporating sunrise seeds, just like Andy suggested. Leo agreed to meet under the old oak tree that night and collaborate on the cat mural project with Mei, and he encouraged Peter to consider Diego's gym routines for his knee before their double date.",
