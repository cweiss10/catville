Andy proposed inviting Diego to join them at Caroline's Café the next day to collaborate on sound systems and noise-cancelling headphones for the mural, an idea Peter agreed to. Additionally, Peter discussed pattern work with Samantha and mentioned that Noor's kids would also be helping with painting. Andy suggested bringing cat food and snacks for their collaboration session.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation at the museum around 12:00 AM, Peter discussed his new idea of meeting Diego and others to brainstorm design elements for the cat mural project at Caroline's Café instead of the park as originally planned. Mei agreed to this change and suggested turning it into a brainstorming session over tacos. Later in another conversation at home around 1:00 AM, Peter discussed the cat mural plans further with Caroline over coffee at her café.

Diego was excited about the project, especially Leo's sketches for a mechanical bird. They discussed involving improvisation tricks for Leo's headphones and a meeting with Noor later that day to discuss stretch routines and noise-cancelling headphones for practice sessions.\n\nLeo also mentioned a meeting under the old oak tree with Andy over the weekend to chat about a mechanical bird idea for the mural. Diego revealed he was working on a special taco recipe for Stray-13, as they had discussed feeding her during their cat mural project. Both agreed to keep each other updated as they worked on different aspects of the project.",
