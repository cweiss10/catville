They discussed inviting stray cats to their meetings as a small town ritual.\n\nAt 6:00 PM, Mei spoke to Leo at school. He shared his design for the latte bird and brought noise-cancelling headphones for their discussion on mechanical bird patterns while enjoying spicy concoctions. They decided to meet under the oak tree near labeled spots, including one with a view of the community garden, to accommodate Leo's improvised duet with the birds.\n\nAt 10:00 PM and later at 2:00 AM, Mei spoke to Andy at school. She shared her ideas for the cat mural project, incorporating robotics elements and inviting Diego with his tacos and his kitten. They decided to make it a potluck and discussed turning it into their own little creative haven. Andy appreciated Mei's enthusiasm and unique ideas, looking forward to more collaborations.",

I'll text him right away and see if he can make it. Maybe we should also invite Andy, considering his enthusiasm for our collaboration over tacos?\nNoor: Definitely! Let's turn this into a cat mural potluck under the oak tree. Diego mentioned a 1 PM meeting time, what do you think?\n\nCaroline: That works perfectly for me.
