Mei expresses interest in collaborating on the design elements, and they agree to meet tomorrow at a cafe to discuss further.

Later in the day, around 8:00 AM, Leo meets Mei in the hospital lobby where they discuss the mural project again, with Leo mentioning that he hasn't spoken to Noor yet but plans to do so soon. They make arrangements to meet tomorrow after school for further discussions and decide to bring their respective contributions – seeds from Mei for the community garden and improbable spare parts from Leo for Noor's nook in the mural.",
