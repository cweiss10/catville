We can talk about improbable spare parts too.\n\nMei: Absolutely! Seeing as you've been dealing with that pesky squirrel lately. Let's catch up over coffee at 3 PM then. And by the way, Peter mentioned he'll be joining us this weekend for a double date with Diego at the library.\n\nNoor: Oh great! I'm excited to hear more about his ideas. I've also been speaking with Samantha from the theater and think she could bring something unique to our project. Maybe we can invite her too?\n\nMei: Yes, definitely!
