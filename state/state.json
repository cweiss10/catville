Andy has invited everyone to bring chamomile tea for the stray cats near Main Street Tacos.\n\nSamantha, who had been working on some coding for the project at a hospital, will join with a surprise contribution to the collaboration tonight at Main Street Tacas. Andy and Caroline are planning to invite her to the double date tomorrow as well. Diego and Samantha discussed their meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow, and Andy confirmed that Peter is finalized to pick up chamomile tea for stray cats beforehand. The team is set to finalize designs and collaborations under the gazebo tomorrow afternoon, with Diego suggesting they incorporate sunrise seeds in their cat mural design based on a conversation he had with Noor at the market today. Andy, Peter, Leo, and Mei are also on board with an improvised symphony, and plans to finalize parts have been made for their meeting tomorrow. After their discussion under the old oak tree, Diego offers to treat everyone to street tacos afterwards.\n\nFollowing a conversation with Samantha, Andy mentioned that she has some amazing ideas for incorporating sunrise seeds into the mural design, and praised her dedication and precision in coding, which he believes will make this project even more impressive. The team looks forward to their collaboration and creating something unique and memorable together.",
