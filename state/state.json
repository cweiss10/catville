Leo suggested they could incorporate these bird melodies into their duets at the park. Samantha agreed and offered to teach Leo improvisation tricks for his headphones.

Leo asked Diego to help collect twigs from the oak tree as well.\n\nIn addition, Leo talked to Noor at town_hall around 3:00 PM, discussing the cat mural collaboration.
