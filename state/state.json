They also discuss involving Mei's students in contributing their own street sounds and collaborating with Leo on the bird melodies. The tea party under the old oak tree the next day is confirmed with everyone attending, including Peter and Diego, who will bring fresh mint tea. Whiskers' brother is expected to make a surprise appearance. Andy and Samantha also plan to meet at the library that night to finalize city sounds details with Mei before the gathering. The art project, including a cat mural collaboration, is eagerly anticipated as a special day for their town, with Caroline bringing street tacos and Diego's kitten potentially participating.",
