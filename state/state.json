She suggested an animal art addition, and we're inviting everyone involved, including Mei's zine club.\n\nCaroline: That sounds amazing, Andy! I spoke with Peter earlier today and he brought up Noor joining us. He also thought of adding some violin touches to our artwork.\n\nAndy: That'd be beautiful! What about involving yoga elements as you suggested? And have you heard from Leo about him joining the project?\n\nCaroline: I haven't, but Peter mentioned that Leo expressed interest and recommended a meeting this Thursday for street tacos. How about a double date with Diego at the library next week? We could feed stray animals together as part of our experience.\n\nAndy: That sounds perfect! It would be a wonderful bonding experience for everyone, especially involving Diego in feeding the park strays. I'm really excited about this, Caroline.

We should definitely catch up over some good food before the brainstorming session, what do you think?\n\nNoor: Agreed! Let's make it a double date with Mei and Peter, if they're free of course. And don't forget our stretching routine beforehand!\n\nDiego: You got it! Looking forward to it. By the way, I was at the museum last night discussing plans for that community garden with Mei. We should coordinate our ideas soon.\n\nNoor: That sounds great! I'm also excited about Leo's robotics club joining in. Let's keep each other updated, alright? See you on Tuesday!",
