Caroline appreciated Andy's artistic vision and mentioned her lavender latte inspired by one of Andy's sunrise sketches. Andy expressed interest in trying it out and suggested planning a quadruple date over these drinks at the cafe the next day, which Caroline agreed to.

I'm excited to see how it turns out!\n\nNoor: That sounds amazing! I also spoke with Samantha about incorporating the squirrel song into our field trip plans with Diego. We're meeting at Main Street Tacos later to work out the details.\n\nCaroline: Oh, I haven't heard about that yet! You two are really making this project come together nicely. And don't forget, we planned a library duet performance session tonight at El Charro if you feel up to it.\n\nNoor: Absolutely, let's make some music together tonight. Thanks for reminding me!

We should collaborate on that squirrel song soon.\n\nPeter: Agreed, Leo. The squirrel song might just be the breakthrough we need for the cat art project. Let's discuss it over dinner at El Charro tonight. Say, have you heard about Samantha's plans for strays behind the cafe?\n\nLeo: Yes, I did. She seems quite passionate about animals, and I like that in a partner. By the way, I've been thinking... would you mind if I invite her to our duet tomorrow at the park?\n\nPeter: Not at all, Leo!
