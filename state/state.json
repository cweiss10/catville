Maybe we can join him if my knee cooperates.\n\nNoor: That sounds like a great plan! Don't forget our brainstorming session tomorrow at Andy's, where we can discuss more details. Plus, I heard Samantha is proposing a quadruple date this weekend.\n\nDiego: Sounds perfect! Let's invite Leo, Caroline, and maybe Mei too. And speaking of cats, how about Leo brings treats for them during our meetings? It could inspire more cat murals around town.\n\nNoor: I love that idea! Let's do it.
