Looks like we both have quite the schedule ahead!\n\nCaroline: Indeed we do, but it'll be a blast! Speaking of schedules, did you remember our quadruple date this weekend at the library? I can't wait to see your new robotics experiments on display.\n\nNoor: Absolutely! Can't forget that one, especially since I get to show off my students' work. By the way, I talked to Samantha about our musical element for the mural – we're meeting at El Charro tomorrow before our meeting with Andy. Are you free?\n\nCaroline: Oh, of course!

Caroline mentions coordinating schedules for a double date with Diego and Noor, which Leo confirms will be on Sunday. They also plan to feed stray cats together prior to their meetings.\n\nLater in the night, Leo talks to Diego about the double date, squirrel song, mural project, and potential additions like a yoga corner and zine club friends' performance.
