She mentioned meeting with Samantha the next day and asked if the cat mural design was finalized with Andy. Peter confirmed they would meet in the morning, also mentioning Diego's latte art concept and inviting her to a brainstorm session that evening.\n\nMei agreed to join the brainstorm session and suggested meeting at Caroline's Café tomorrow morning instead of the park. Both agreed to catch up. Peter emphasized the importance of small rituals making strong towns before ending the conversation.\n\nLater in the day, around 4:00 PM, Peter talked to Andy at home. They discussed incorporating Diego's latte art into the cat mural and agreed to discuss further details at the gym and finalize the design over coffee. Peter also mentioned Leo's music contributions and promised to bring chamomile seeds for Caroline's garden.
