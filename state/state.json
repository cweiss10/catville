We can start with planning the squirrel latte art yoga moves for the modern art wing and finalize the mural walk with Peter. And I brought some seeds from my garden that could work well in the cat mural design.\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic! Speaking of collaboration, Caroline mentioned a bird duet performance at the park as part of our extended gathering this weekend. Are you excited?\n\nMei: Absolutely!

The blending of art and music is something I've always wanted to explore more, and your unique ideas only make it more exciting!\n\nSamantha: Speaking of which, did Andy mention anything about involving Noor's science club in the design process for the mural? I think their creative input would be valuable.\n\nLeo: Indeed, he did. And I think it's a fantastic idea. Let's make sure we have enough treats for the neighborhood strays too; they've become quite accustomed to us!\n\nSamantha: Agreed. Perhaps we can plan our rehearsal at the gazebo tomorrow afternoon, so we can coordinate with them during the workshop at the park. Shall I bring some leftovers for the cats as well?\n\nLeo: That sounds like a perfect plan, Samantha. I'll see you there, and let's make our community proud with this unique cat mural!",
