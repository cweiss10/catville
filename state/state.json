Let's discuss further under the gazebo trees tonight at 7 PM, after our respective meetings with Peter and Andy.

They also discussed a collaborative mural project and a squirrel latte art contest.\n\nLater, at around 5:00 PM, Leo had another conversation with Noor at a cafe where they talked about their collaboration, and Leo promised to ask Mei about the squirrel latte art contest. They also discussed feeding stray cats before dinner. Leo reminded Noor to bring her violin for the bird duet rehearsal.\n\nIn addition to these conversations, Andy suggested finalizing plans for the gazebo meeting that night and asked Leo to pick up some cat food from Diego beforehand. They both looked forward to their collaborative projects.",
