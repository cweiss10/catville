Andy's excitement about Diego's mechanical bird ideas for the mural was shared with Mei, and it was decided to discuss these at the zine club rehearsal the next day, where Diego expressed his interest in helping Andy overcome creative blocks as well.\n\nIn the late hours of the night, Mei spoke to Samantha at a cafe around 2:00 AM, discussing the arrangement of logic puzzles for the mural. They agreed to meet at the oak tree the following day at 10 AM to work on it together and bring snacks. Around 3:00 AM, Mei also spoke to Andy about his sketch for the mechanical bird, planning to discuss it under the oak tree during their potluck gathering the next day. They agreed to bring chamomile tea and noise-cancelling headphones respectively. Diego expressed excitement about the collaboration and suggested bringing ingredients for a chamomile latte. Samantha also showed enthusiasm for the project and plans to collaborate with Andy on the mechanical bird design. Overall, the team is making progress in creating a unique project for their town.",
