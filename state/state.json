You're just in time. I was thinking of you too. I've been brainstorming how to incorporate robotics into our mural design. What's your idea?\n\nDiego: Well, I was hoping we could collaborate with Andy on some squirrel latte art for the mural. It'd add a fun touch and align with our cat theme.\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic! And speaking of the event, have you talked to Mei about using seeds from her community garden? We can make it more interactive for attendees.\n\nDiego: I haven't yet, but I'll reach out to her today. I'm looking forward to working together on this project and making a positive impact in our community.",
