Around 6:00 AM, she talks to Noor about the cat mural project at the theater, where Noor's robotics club will contribute mechanical birds. They also discuss ensuring Whiskers' little brother in the sunrise sketches looks adorable, as Diego needs to finalize the design before meeting Andy at the mural site. At 1:00 PM, Caroline talks to Diego at a train station and updates him on the progress of the cat mural project, including Noor's robotics club's involvement and a planned meet-up under an oak tree with chamomile lattes. Diego expresses excitement for their bird duet collaboration and they arrange to set everything up together at the mural site the next morning with Andy.",

They agree to involve the students in creating mechanical birds inspired by Leo's improvised duets with the park birds. Around 11:00 AM, Samantha expresses enthusiasm for Leo's city night tune for their art event and offers ideas based on stray cats around town for their collaboration. They agree to meet at the community garden that evening, with Samantha bringing chamomile tea.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, Leo talks to Andy at a restaurant who shares sketches of ideas for their collaborative project under the old oak tree. They discuss involving Diego and Caroline in the plans, agreeing to meet tomorrow after their group workout to further discuss details with tea and street tacos. Andy suggests bringing a kitten for creative inspiration.\n\nPeter suggests having the bird duet performance at the old oak tree as part of the cat mural event. Leo agrees and proposes turning it into a potluck, inviting Peter to bring chamomile lattes and stretch together before discussion. They plan to meet at 10:00 AM the following day at the park.
