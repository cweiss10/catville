I'm looking forward to brainstorming more ideas with everyone at Main Street Tacos tomorrow. By the way, don't forget to bring your headphones so we can work on our separate tasks simultaneously.\n\nNoor: You got it!

After discussing this earlier at the museum, they had another conversation about the cat mural location, with Andy suggesting an old oak tree in the park as a perfect canvas. They agreed to further discuss their projects, including bringing bird duets to life with robotics, at Main Street Tacos the next day. Mei shared plans for the cat mural project with Diego and Peter. All of them are excited about creating something magical for their town. Andy invites more people, including Caroline, Noor's students, Samantha, and Peter to join the discussions tomorrow at 6 PM. Leo mentions he will bring his violin and some spare parts for the tech side of things.",
