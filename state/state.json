The group also discusses a yoga session with Diego at the market before diving into creative projects.\n\nLater in the day around 1:00 PM, Leo has a conversation with Andy at a cafe. Andy is excited about Leo's improvisational piece from the previous day's rehearsal for Peter's show and is intrigued by the idea of a hidden reading nook in the park mural design. Andy suggests inviting Noor and Caroline to join the team for the project, to which Leo agrees. Leo then sends out invites for their meeting at the community garden this Thursday and reminds Andy about the double date they planned with Samantha and Diego.\n\nAround 2:00 PM, Leo talks to Caroline at a cafe, where she expresses excitement about collaborating on the hidden reading nook in the mural project. They make plans to discuss it further during Leo's gig that evening and over coffee at the cafe.\n\nLater at 9:00 PM, while at a cafe, Mei approaches Diego to compliment his latte art. Diego expresses interest in collaborating with the group on their mural project, specifically the hidden reading nook. Leo, who overhears the conversation, invites Peter to join the team, stating they can make a significant impact in their town.",
