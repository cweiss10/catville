I can't wait to try it!\n\nMei: You should definitely swing by the cafe tomorrow morning for breakfast. And perhaps we could discuss the mechanical bird details while enjoying Diego's latte art?\n\nSamantha: That sounds lovely, Mei. I'll bring my laptop and let's get this project off the ground. By the way, have you seen Stray-13 around lately? He hasn't visited the cafe in a while.\n\nMei: Yes, actually! I left some food for him behind the cafe as usual. Let's hope he'll be there tomorrow so Luna can join us too. Looking forward to working with you again, Samantha.",
