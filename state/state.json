Samantha discussed finishing another open-source project, feeding stray cats, and meeting Diego and Caroline at Main Street Tacos the next day for discussions about the cat mural project and music under the stars.\n\nSamantha suggested a coffee meeting at 6 AM under an old oak tree and collaborating on a piece for their potential quadruple date under the gazebo trees, involving Andy and Noor with their squirrel lattes. They also planned to feed stray cats together and make improvisations before continuing discussions about the cat mural project.\n\nDuring a 5:00 AM conversation at a cafe, Samantha praised Leo's improvisations in the park and Andy suggested using sunrise seeds in the design of the cat mural project. They also discussed their friendly competition for the quadruple date and making sure they both bring their best performances. Andy offered to prepare homemade chamomile tea to help them focus, and Leo promised some impressive violin improvisations.\n\nIn the afternoon, Leo had a conversation with Andy at the market around 6:00 PM about the cat mural project. Andy shared updates on the meeting under the gazebo that night, suggesting using sunrise seeds in the design and discussing Caroline's squirrel latte blend. They also reiterated their friendly competition for their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos and agreed to feed stray cats before getting started.
