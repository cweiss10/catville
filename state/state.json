Andy learns about a meeting under the gazebo tonight with Peter and Leo to discuss the project with Samantha. He plans to bring snacks for stray cats.\n\nAndy speaks with Diego at home around 4:00 PM, discussing street tacos, cat food, and reminiscing about their conversation at the market. Andy invites Diego to join them for a coffee catch-up tomorrow. They discuss ideas for an interactive performance for the birds. Later in the evening, Andy speaks with Diego again at the hospital around 9:00 PM.\n\nDuring their conversation, Andy and Diego discuss Diego stretching before creative sessions, Andy's successful rehearsal with Caroline, and Andy inviting Diego to join them for the meeting at Main Street Tacos to elevate their tree mural project. They also discuss integrating robotics into the bird duet and plan to further discuss details over tacos tomorrow. Andy reminds Diego not to forget to bring cat treats from Caroline's café for the stray cats.\n\nLater, at 11:00 PM, Andy talks to Noor about their projects. He proposes integrating robotics into the tree design of the cat mural and suggests bringing Leo on board. They discuss organizing a squirrel latte art contest for their community event. Andy asks about the bird duet rehearsal tomorrow and plans to meet at Main Street Tacos as scheduled. Noor thanks him for the sunrise seeds he gave her, which she will plant under the gazebo trees. They discuss feeding the stray cats before dinner after the bird duet practice.",
