Andy suggests a taco party during their meeting at Caroline's café to celebrate their collaboration. Caroline agrees, mentioning the need to consider Stray-13's sensitive stomach when choosing the tacos. Both parties express appreciation for each other and look forward to their joint endeavor.\n\nIn a separate conversation, Caroline talks to Peter at the gym around 10:00 AM. She asks for his insights about Diego's knee injury from his fitness reading and proposes discussing it over a latte at her café. Peter agrees, and they plan to meet before their mural meeting with Diego's tacos. Caroline assures Peter she will make the best latte art possible to keep the noise down for his robotics club.",

Have you spoken to Peter about the mechanical birds for the mural?\n\nDiego: Yeah, he's on board and excited to collaborate! He even suggested some interesting music ideas.

I know everyone will love it. Oh, and speaking of additions, Caroline mentioned she wants to share some seeds for Stray-13's cat mural from her community garden.
