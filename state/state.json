During an evening encounter, Andy discusses the project with Mei, proposing a meeting at the market early the next day to further discuss ideas. They plan collaborations with Caroline on her singing gig at the theater and a city sounds collaboration with Noor at Mei's gym later in the week. Mei suggests incorporating seeds from the community garden into their zine as a small touch, aiming to make the project special for everyone involved. Andy also arranges a separate meeting with Samantha to discuss the artistic and technological aspects of the mural. After discussing with Peter, they decide to adjust the meeting time under the oak tree to 7:30 PM tonight to collaborate with Leo. Caroline promises street tacos at their cafe during this busy week for the project.",

Yes, I've been hearing some amazing things. Speaking of music, Caroline suggested we collaborate on a piece for the community event. I thought it might be nice to practice under the oak tree tonight?\"\n\nMei: \"That sounds wonderful, Leo. Let's make sure to grab those street tacos afterwards as usual.\"\n\nLeo: \"Sounds perfect! And if you don't mind, I invited Andy and Samantha to join us for a cat mural collaboration. They're both quite passionate about it.\"\n\nMei: \"That's great news! The more we can bring our community together, the better. See you under the oak tree tonight then!\"",
