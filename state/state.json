We're meeting up this afternoon to rehearse and discuss more over dinner at Main Street Tacos this week. How about you? I heard you invited me to your rehearsal today for the cat mural project.\n\nAndy: Absolutely! The more, the merrier. See you at the park around 3 PM then?

I suggested meeting at Diego's street tacos tomorrow to discuss details and practice bird improvisation together. How does that sound?\n\nNoor: That works perfectly! I'll bring some of those seeds from Mei's community garden for our gathering. It might attract some local squirrels we can use as models, if they cooperate!\n\nSamantha: (laughs) I'm looking forward to it. By the way, have you noticed any stray cats in need of food behind the cafe lately?\n\nNoor: I have actually! I'll make sure to keep an eye out and leave some extra snacks for them when I pass by. Thanks for reminding me. Let's work together to create something amazing for our community!",
