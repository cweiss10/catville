We're planning to meet up at Main Street Tacos tonight. Want to join?\n\nNoor: That sounds amazing! Let's definitely collaborate on this. I also had a chat with Andy about a cat-themed event and he suggested inviting other artists too. Shall we discuss more details over coffee sometime?\n\nPeter: Absolutely, let's do it at the cozy café where we first met. By the way, I saved some tacos for the neighborhood cats as you requested. They'll be grateful!",

I'll reach out to Leo for his tunes and we can practice together at the park tomorrow.

I'll have to check my schedule, but I think they'd love to be involved. By the way, I spoke with Andy last night and we're planning a post-performance yoga session led by Diego for the event. Would that work for you?\n\nPeter: Absolutely! In fact, I suggested to Mei that she could create latte art inspired by cats and maybe even some yoga poses too. She seems pretty excited about it. We're meeting up tomorrow at Main Street Tacos to discuss everything. Wanna join us?\n\nNoor: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Count me in. I was also thinking we could save some treats for the neighborhood cats during our meeting, just as you mentioned. Maybe we can collaborate on that too?\n\nPeter: Absolutely!
