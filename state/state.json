Caroline agrees, and they plan for Peter to keep the cozy vibe intact. During their conversation, Peter mentions his collaboration with Mei on the mural project and expresses interest in joining forces with Andy's cat mural project. Caroline suggests this as a potential fit and promises to bring tea for the gathering at the oak tree that night. They also discuss Caroline and Noor's mechanical bird project and arrange for Peter to lend ideas during their practice session the following day. Peter agrees to make the community event something special, and they plan to meet around 4 PM.",
