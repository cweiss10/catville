Later, at a town hall around 7:00 AM, Caroline shared that Mei is growing sunrise seeds for their cat mural, which excites everyone. They also confirmed their double date in the park tomorrow for bird duet practice and finalizing details during their quadruple date on Saturday.\n\nDuring a subsequent conversation at the museum around 8:00 AM, Leo revealed he has chosen 'Canon in D' as the song for their bird duet and is practicing improvisation with local birds. Caroline expressed excitement about the plans and suggested meeting at a café for latte art after his practice tonight. Leo also hinted at a surprise involving his theater tech skills to set up spotlights in quiet spaces at the gallery show.",

And don't forget to share your new melody with Noor and Diego during the practice session at the park. Maybe we can even involve Mei in creating squirrel latte art for the cat mural project?\n\nLeo: That sounds like a fantastic idea! I'll see you around, Caroline. Let's catch up more about these plans later this week.\n\nCaroline: Sounds good, Leo. Looking forward to it!",

Maybe we can explore together another time?\n\nLeo: That would be wonderful! It'd be like a musical-artistic adventure, don't you think?\n\n*Both share a smile and continue their separate journeys in the museum.*",

He's keen to join us for the project and suggested some violin melodies. What do you think?\n\nDiego: That sounds great! I was also planning to discuss flexibility exercises with Samantha for our yoga movements in the mural design, given her help with my knee injury. Noor agreed to invite Mei as well for that quadruple date this weekend, right?\n\nLeo: Absolutely! I'm excited about working together on this project, Diego.
