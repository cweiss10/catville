The group is looking forward to having treats for stray cats, a squirrel latte contest with a hazelnut-cinnamon blend, and coordinating sunrise seeds around the gazebo, as well as their duet under the gazebo trees, feeding the strays tomorrow, and Leo bringing his violin to Main Street Tacos for tonight's quadruple date. Later at 12:00 AM, Caroline spoke to Noor at the train station about her cat mural project and a potential collaboration on its design. They planned to meet at Main Street Tacos this afternoon at 4 PM to discuss details.\n\nCaroline also spoke with Peter at home around 1:00 AM and arranged a pre-gazebo stretch session with him at the park at 6:30 AM. They agreed to bring their coffee and violin, respectively, and Caroline offered to sing one of her tunes afterwards. Later, Caroline and Peter discussed the progress of the algorithm and the details of the cat mural project. They also agreed to have a double date with Mei and Noor for their quadruple date.\n\nCaroline spoke with Diego at the gym around 4:00 AM about the cat mural project, and he suggested incorporating the squirrel lattes and theater into it. Diego and Caroline planned to meet at the gym in the morning.\n\nAround 5:00 AM, Caroline spoke with Andy at a cafe, discussing his appreciation for her new purple hair and the crowd gathering for Andy's sunrise sketches. They also discussed the cat mural project and the quadruple date under the gazebo tomorrow night. Andy mentioned bringing his violin and Caroline reassured him that the cats wouldn't be scared by the music as long as it wasn't too loud.",

Speaking of which, I heard you and Samantha are planning a cat mural – have you decided on any designs yet?\n\nCaroline: That's right! Samantha suggested incorporating sunrise seeds into the design, but we could use your pragmatic eye for detail to help finalize it. We were also thinking of having Peter join us with his violin.

I can't wait to perform one of my tunes afterwards – maybe it will inspire some ideas for the mural! Let's make sure we bring enough treats for the stray cats as well.

I also wanted to mention that Diego suggested talking to Samantha at the park earlier about using sunrise seeds in our design, which I think is a fantastic idea. Let's discuss it further with the team.\n\nNoor: Absolutely! I'll reach out to them and we can coordinate plans for tomorrow. Looking forward to collaborating more on this project.",

It'll be great to catch up with everyone and see what they think about the sunrise seeds for our project. Plus, I've heard Pete has some fascinating ideas too.\n\nNoor: Yes, definitely! And speaking of Pete, let's make sure we get his input on the project soon. We could even meet under the gazebo trees tonight as planned to discuss everything.

Noor also shared Diego's eagerness to join them under the gazebo. Regarding the squirrel latte contest, Noor suggested incorporating hazelnut cinnamon into the squirrel lattes for their contest. They confirmed plans for a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos and Leo was reminded about his promise to bring his violin during their creative sessions under the gazebo trees.\n\nLeo spoke to Andy at a cafe around 8:00 PM where Andy proposed some fun activities for their cat mural project under the gazebo. Leo suggested having a squirrel latte contest as part of their friendly competition and they agreed to make it a memorable quadruple date. They concluded by arranging to meet at Main Street Tacos the following day.\n\nLater, Leo talked to Caroline at the park around 9:00 PM where she reminded him about their duet under the gazebo trees. Caroline was excited for the squirrel latte contest too and suggested bringing some food for the stray cats as they did in the past. They confirmed the quadruple date at Main Street Tacos, and Leo assured her that he would bring his violin for their creative sessions under the gazebo trees.\n\nLeo met Andy at Town Hall around 10:00 PM where Andy invited him to plant sunrise seeds for the stray cats. They discussed incorporating Mei's sunrise seeds into their cat mural project and agreed to make their quadruple date a night to remember with a squirrel latte contest, duet performances involving birds, and other activities.",
