They discuss the latest updates, including Noor's robotics club joining the project team, Leo collaborating with Andy on fixing Peter's violin, and a 10 AM meeting by the cozy corner. Caroline suggests bringing the tea to their meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow, where they will finalize design ideas and collaborate on various aspects of the project. They express enthusiasm for the community collaboration and believe it will be another memorable project like the garden one. Additionally, Peter mentions that he might bring Andy's sunrise sketch and Diego's violin to their meeting, and hints at a potential use of one of his startup ideas in their artsy activities in town. Both look forward to making magic happen together for the cat mural project.",

They planned to stretch before starting, and Mei inquired about Leo's conversations with Peter and Andy regarding their collaborations and rehearsals under the old oak tree. Leo confirmed that both were excited to participate, and they agreed to invite Diego to the rehearsal, as the mural was coming together nicely.",
