Speaking of Leo, have you made plans for your double date at the library?\n\nSamantha: Yes, we picked 'The Art of Improvisation' as our first read. Leo mentioned bringing spare parts from his violin case to incorporate into the mural. Have you had a chance to discuss involving Noor in our project yet?\n\nMei: Not yet, but I plan to bring it up at my zine club meeting today. Let's catch up after that and finalize details over coffee at the cafe, like old times.\n\nSamantha: Sounds great! And don't forget about taking care of the strays before our park meeting this weekend. See you later!\n\nMei: Absolutely, and I'll remind Leo about it too. Take care!",

Leo suggests inviting Samantha to join them at the park meeting. Mei agrees, also mentioning plans for a yoga session with Diego on Saturday.

We could use some of your musical improvisation magic there too.\n\nLeo: That sounds like a wonderful idea! I'll bring up the concept with Samantha during our double date at the library tonight. We're planning to read 'The Art of Improvisation', so it seems fitting.\n\nCaroline: That book is fantastic! Let me know how it goes, and maybe we can work on something together soon.
