Andy is excited about the cat mural project, mentions collaborating with Diego, and suggests using the old oak tree in the park as a canvas, which Leo also suggested earlier. Andy offers cat food for stray cats and spare parts for tech troubleshooting. They agree to feed the stray cats together and meet at Main Street Tacos the following day. At 6:00 AM, Caroline talks to Andy at the museum. Andy shares that he bumped into Diego at a cafe and that they are all joining forces for the cat mural project. Caroline agrees to contribute with her squirrel latte art and possibly a musical performance. Andy also mentions his cat mural collaboration with Noor going great, and they'll both be present at Main Street Tacos discussions this week. Everyone is excited about the community project coming together.",
