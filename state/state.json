Caroline mentions a potential collaboration with Peter on a cat mural, making their town buzz.\n\nAt 2:00 PM, Mei talks to Samantha at the gym and discusses incorporating sunrise seeds into her cat mural project. Andy suggests this idea to Mei at the theater around 3:00 PM, and they agree to bring it up in a meeting under the old oak tree. Additionally, Andy proposes offering chamomile tea for stray cats during their event, which Mei finds appealing.\n\nAround 4:00 PM, Andy invites Mei, Peter, Diego, and Noor for dinner under the gazebo to discuss cat mural plans. Mei suggests expanding the gathering to include a quadruple date and sharing updates on other projects like the symphony and community garden. Andy also shares his new squirrel latte design for their gym singing session, which excites Mei.\n\nAt 6:00 PM, Mei talks to Noor at the train station. Noor proposes incorporating sunrise seeds into the cat mural plans and suggests adding chamomile tea for stray cats under the old oak tree. They also discuss involving Diego in both projects. The group continues to collaborate and share creative ideas.",
