I've got a few logic puzzles to share at our meeting under the old oak tree today.

Have you finalized your musical ideas for the mural project?\n\nLeo: Yes, I've been working on a rhythm-based algorithm based on my bird duets. How about you? Did Mei bring any tea for our symphony discussions?\n\nAndy: Not yet, but she promised to bring some along later tonight. Have you spoken with Peter about automating the watering system like we planned?\n\nLeo: Yes, he's on board. We're also discussing the possibility of Samantha adding her logic puzzles into our symphony. Exciting times!\n\nAndy: Agreed! I can't wait to see this collaboration come together. Let's make sure we have a good cup of tea for tonight, shall we?\n\nLeo: Sounds perfect! See you under the old oak tree tomorrow then, Andy.",
