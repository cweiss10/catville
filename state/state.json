They agreed to meet up at the community garden under the old oak tree that night with Kitty as the event's mascot. Andy suggested a sketch session at the park beforehand.

Peter suggests incorporating mechanical birds created by Noor's students, which Mei also finds appealing as a part of the bird duet under the old oak tree. They agree to make the event unforgettable and discuss adding native plants from the community garden. Mei proposes labeling each plant for visitors to appreciate them more. Peter suggests starting with a pre-event workout to get everyone energized, while Mei plans on having chamomile tea ready afterward for relaxation and discussing the garden project. Kitty, the cat, is agreed upon as their little mascot for the day.",

At 3:00 PM, Leo and Caroline met to invite Mei's zine club and confirm Noor's robotics students' involvement. Later at a cafe around 5:00 PM, Diego asked about the progress of the mechanical birds for the cat mural project, to which Leo responded they had been sketched out at the park. Excited about the collaboration, Diego proposed meeting him at the community garden that evening to work on the mechanical bird designs for Whiskers' little brother. Leo agreed, expressing excitement to bring his own ideas and discuss incorporating them into their cat mural project. They also mentioned hearing about chamomile lattes at the meeting location.\n\nAt 10:00 PM, Leo talked to Noor at school, who expressed her excitement to be part of the collaboration. Leo shared his sketches and discussed bringing Noor's robotics students together with the cat mural team under the old oak tree. They planned to make some music together and bring a kitten for inspiration. At 11:00 PM, Leo talked to Peter at the train station. The group continued their discussions at the museum around 7:00 PM in preparation for their creative gathering under the old oak tree.",
