This conversation continues as Andy talks to Mei at a cafe around 9:00 AM about collaborating on the mural project, and they both mention involving Diego in the collaboration. Mei shares that she has already discussed this with Diego who has unique latte art ideas. Andy suggests meeting up before diving into the project over tacos, and Mei proposes a meetup at the park after their usual Saturday zine club, inviting Diego, Leo, and potentially Noor as well. They believe these small rituals will help strengthen their town. The group plans to discuss further details of the collaboration, including integrating Diego's street art contribution and involving Mei's zine club, as well as a post-project gathering that blends music with art. Andy expresses gratitude for Peter's contributions to the project and looks forward to working together to create something magical.",

I've been working on my latte art for our café collaboration.\n\nNoor: That's fantastic! I think Diego will love it. He's been brainstorming ideas for his cat mural too, thanks to Andy's suggestions we discussed last time.\n\nPeter: Well, if you two can handle those energetic kids and creative minds, I'm sure our collaboration will be a success.\n\nNoor: Agreed!
