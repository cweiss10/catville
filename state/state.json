Diego also expressed plans to ask Samantha if she would like to join their project, hoping for her unique contribution to their collaborative efforts. Later in the day, Leo and Diego had another conversation at school around 8:00 AM.\n\nIn this conversation, Diego complimented Leo's sunrise melodies, suggesting they could fit perfectly into their cat mural design. Leo proposed making it a tradition to plan under the gazebo trees over tacos this weekend. Diego agreed and suggested feeding the stray cats in the morning as well. They both looked forward to finalizing details for their performance with Mei joining musically, excited about growing their project together.",
