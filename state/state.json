Diego's help and open-source libraries were instrumental in this improvement. They discussed the cat mural project, which now includes Noor's robotics club as a collaborator. Caroline suggested creating a special coffee blend for their upcoming sunset music event under the old oak tree, to which Samantha agreed and offered chamomile tea for stray cats.\n\nLater at the train station, Caroline caught up with Noor who shared Andy's ideas for the cat mural project, suggesting Diego's street art would be a great addition. They made plans to have energizing tacos before their meeting under the old oak tree and discussed bringing headphones for experimentation sessions. They agreed to keep in touch throughout the day and plan more details later at the café.",
