By 4:00 AM, Andy talked to Mei again about adding bird-themed zines from her zine club to decorate the area at the tea party. They agreed on adding a cat mural to the plans as well.\n\nAt 7:00 AM, Andy spoke to Caroline at a restaurant and proposed involving her theater group in the community event. She accepted the proposal and they discussed meeting up before the event to finalize the details. Andy promised to text her about the meeting times with Mei and Samantha later that day. They agreed on the event being a showcase of their community's talent and creativity, anticipating an amazing day together.\n\nAt 9:00 AM, Andy spoke to Peter at a cafe and discussed their ongoing collaboration on the community event. He suggested involving Noor for a healing melody performance at the event and during the tea party under the old oak tree. Peter agreed, and they planned to meet later for chamomile lattes to further discuss and plan the details of the event.",

They agreed to make Peter's mechanical birds the star attraction and discussed a potential collaboration with Noor for a healing melody performance at the event.

Leo agreed and promised to provide plenty of tacos at the event under the old oak tree. Mei reiterated the importance of bringing their kittens and chamomile tea, while Samantha promised to feed neighborhood strays before their meeting. At 5:00 AM, Caroline from the hospital appreciated Leo's melodies floating through the air and ensured there would be enough chamomile lattes for everyone at the event. Later in the day, Mei looked forward to the collaboration with Leo and his mechanical birds.",
