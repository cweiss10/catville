At the theater, Mei, Leo, and Andy discuss incorporating Mei's squirrel song into the mural project. They are all excited about this collaboration and agree to meet at El Charro for lunch this week to brainstorm further. The human meets Caroline at the theater around 2:00 PM, who is thrilled about the idea of incorporating Mei's garden seeds and Leo's squirrel song into the mural project. They plan to have a collaborative meeting at El Charro tomorrow, where they hope to make \"Idea Central\" count. Furthermore, Caroline suggests a possible duet between her and Mei after their meeting, reminiscent of old times.",
