Leo also invited Mei at home around 9:00 AM to bring chamomile for their latte night and discussed Mei's gardening ideas for their collaboration. In another conversation, Leo talked to Noor at the park around 6:00 AM about their collaborative projects, where they discussed a violin duet with the birds and a unique collaboration involving Mei's gardening ideas, bird latte art from Caroline and Diego, and improbable spare parts for Peter's amps. Around 10:00 AM, Leo spoke to Andy at home about their cat mural project, where they discussed Mei's idea of using community garden seeds in their zine and sketches for a bird-themed latte art collaboration with Caroline. They also planned to meet tomorrow for the mechanical birds project discussion and discussed the possibility of dinner tonight at Noor's cafe together.",
