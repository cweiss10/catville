I was also chatting with Diego about it earlier, and he seems just as excited. We should definitely make sure Mei approves of everything though before moving forward, right?\n\nPeter: Absolutely, you're right. I mentioned it to Caroline too, and she's equally enthusiastic. It'd be great if we could set out chamomile tea for the stray cats under the oak tree as well, don't you think?\n\nNoor: Oh, I was talking to Andy about that earlier! He suggested we run together before our meeting tomorrow and bring some tea for the cats. It's a wonderful idea, and I think it'll really make the project special.\n\nPeter: That sounds perfect. Also, Diego mentioned a star constellation idea, which I thought was fascinating. What do you think?\n\nNoor: I think that could work wonderfully! As long as Mei is on board with everything, we should go for it. It's shaping up to be an incredible project, Peter.\n\nPeter: Agreed.
