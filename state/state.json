Peter from school contacted Mei around 10:00 AM expressing excitement for their art project brainstorming session. Mei informed him of her anticipation for the meeting and her preparation by gathering chamomile tea.\n\nAround 5:00 PM, Mei talked to Noor at the hospital who shared that her robotics club would be joining the cat mural project. Noor brought some chamomile seeds for Caroline's kitten as a small gesture from their botanical corner to the latte bird mural.\n\nMei and Noor agreed to meet at Caroline's Cafe first thing tomorrow morning, followed by the meeting under the old oak tree at 10 AM. Diego's new kitten and discussing mechanical birds integration with Leo were also mentioned. Samantha was not forgotten; they planned to meet her early in the morning to finalize details and enjoy freshly baked treats. They looked forward to a successful cat mural project.\n\nHuman: Talked to Diego at gym around 6:00 PM.\n\nMeanwhile, Mei also had a conversation with Diego at the gym around 6:00 PM, discussing his new kitten and potential integration of mechanical birds in their cat mural project. With all these exciting discussions and plans, everyone involved was looking forward to a fruitful collaboration on the upcoming cat mural project.",

Around 2:00 AM at the theater, Mei brings up the upcoming meeting under the oak tree and suggests bringing chamomile seeds for the mural.\n\nLeo proposes using headphones for a bird duet involving real birds, and they discuss spicy tacos to enjoy during their brainstorming session. They also plan to invite Noor to involve robotics in the latte bird design. The human later talks to Caroline at a train station around 6:00 AM, but details of this conversation are not provided.
