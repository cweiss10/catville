The group agreed to meet separately – Diego with Noor at Caroline's to discuss the details of the mural and with Mei at Main Street Tacos to finalize plans for both events. Additionally, they decided to bring stray cat seeds to their next meeting as a nod to the cat-inspired mural project. The group aims to make this event memorable, collaborating on various aspects such as music, latte art, and mural design.",
