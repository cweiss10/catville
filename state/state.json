I was just thinking about meeting there with Noor and Diego to discuss mechanical birds for the design. Would you mind if we invite Leo too, he has a kitten that might add a charming touch.\n\nPeter: Not at all Mei, let's make it a community event! And thank you for suggesting Kitty as our mascot, I think it fits perfectly.\n\nMei: Of course, Peter. Small rituals can make strong towns after all. Looking forward to seeing you there!",

I'm looking forward to meeting Mei and your friends tomorrow at 3 PM.

Later, around 9:00 AM, Leo talked to Andy at the hospital, who expressed excitement about joining the cat mural project discussion and invited Leo to a tea party under the old oak tree, with Leo bringing his violin for some impromptu melodies. At 12:00 PM, Leo spoke with Diego at the museum, where Diego was excited about collaborating on the mechanical bird sketches and suggested involving Mei's zine club in the project. Leo agreed to this and proposed bringing his kitten along. Diego mentioned that he would have Whiskers' brother's designs ready for review. They agreed to meet at the community garden and discussed having chamomile lattes during their meeting.\n\nAround 1:00 PM, Leo spoke with Mei at the market, who expressed enthusiasm about the mural project and suggested involving Whiskers' brother in the cat mural project under the old oak tree that evening. Leo agreed to bring chamomile lattes for everyone, and they discussed incorporating city sounds into the zine club and the mural.",
