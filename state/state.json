The group further discusses involving a live kitten as inspiration and fueling their creative energy with street tacos. Both Andy and Peter express enthusiasm about these new ideas, aiming to make the project even more engaging.\n\nAt 10:00 PM, Andy talks to Caroline at the town hall. They agree to meet under the old oak tree in the community garden that night, with Leo bringing Kitty as the event's mascot. They also plan a sketch session at the park before their usual meeting spot tomorrow morning. Caroline offers fresh mint leaves for tea and agrees to make it a productive day, aiming to set a strong foundation for the project. Both Andy and Caroline express excitement about the collaboration between them and Andy's students, looking forward to another successful art endeavor.",
