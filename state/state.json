Around 5:00 PM, at the market, she talks to Noor, proposing a collaborative work on their mechanical bird designs under the old oak tree that evening. They agree, inviting Diego and Andy to join them for brainstorming and street tacos. Later, around 6:00 PM, Caroline has a conversation with Leo at a cafe about incorporating city sounds into their mechanical birds' design. Diego is suggested to attend the meeting under the oak tree that evening as well. Caroline invites Mei to join them, turning it into a joint session. They all look forward to creating something magical by combining their ideas, and Leo thanks Caroline for maintaining their cozy vibe at the cafe.",

Later in the conversation, Diego informed Leo that he was ready to meet him, along with their plans for street tacos and a violin duet under the old oak tree.
