In a new development, Mei contacted Leo around 8:00 PM at the train station and proposed an interactive element from Peter for the mural project, suggesting they discuss details at the gazebo tonight. Leo agreed, asking Mei to bring seeds for the community garden. Mei also suggested inviting Noor to join the rehearsal before their taco meeting, which was agreed upon.\n\nIn further conversation, Mei invited Samantha and Noor to join the jam session under the gazebo trees, suggesting they combine their talents for a unique performance. Leo agreed and proposed involving Andy as well, whose musical ideas might bring something special to the table. Finally, Leo remembered he still owes Diego some cat food.",
