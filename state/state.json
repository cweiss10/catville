Diego agreed and suggested discussing it over pre-run coffee at Main Street Tacos as planned. Andy also mentioned a need to automate the garden project, rehearse for their symphony, and invited Diego to join him during one of his sketching sessions at the park.\n\nDiego agreed to stretch properly before the run but assured that he wouldn't hold back on conversations. Lastly, Andy brought up an idea suggested by Noor to provide tea for stray cats before meeting, which Diego found a great idea and agreed to. Both agreed to finalize everything over coffee tomorrow.",

        "summary": " In the cat mural project, the group has decided to meet at Main Street Tacas under the old oak tree the next day at 10 AM. The agenda includes discussing additions to the sunrise seeds initiative, sharing Leo's sketches, providing chamomile tea for stray cats, incorporating music during the event, and a double date with Peter. Additionally, Mei is collaborating with Andy on automating their garden watering system with sunrise seeds.\n\nMei meets up with Diego at the train station, where they discuss further plans for the sunrise seeds initiative the next day and arrange a group run under the old oak tree before having dinner at Main Street Tacos as Noor suggested. They also plan a shared symphony led by Leo under the old oak tree that night to set the mood for their discussions.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, Mei talks to Andy at the park, where he offers chamomile tea for their meeting tomorrow morning during his sunrise sketch session. Mei accepts and also brings seeds from the community garden and some zine club ideas to share. Andy is excited about these contributions to the project.",
