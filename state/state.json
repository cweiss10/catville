Mei also proposes using sunrise seeds in the project, an idea that excites Noor who plans to bring them as a thank you gift for Stray-13. In another conversation, Noor talks to Andy at a restaurant about collaborating on the cat mural project and they decide to brainstorm ideas together over the weekend, inviting Leo and Peter.",
