        "summary": " At 10:00 AM, Mei discusses the cat mural project's unique twist involving music with Caroline at the library. They plan to meet at Caroline's Café the following morning to collaborate further on bringing student performances and squirrel tunes into the project, potentially saving some tacos for neighborhood cats. In addition, they plan to discuss these ideas over coffee this Thursday after latte art rehearsals. Mei also invites Diego to collaborate on the cat mural project and a community workout event, with plans to meet at Main Street for tacos later in the week. The cat mural project continues to gain momentum as more individuals express interest and collaborate towards integrating music into the community event, including Peter's idea of incorporating Diego's cat-inspired latte art.",
