There seems to be some interesting ideas about squirrel latte art and interactive characters for the mural.\n\nNoor: Oh, hi Peter! Yes, let's definitely meet there. It sounds like everyone is getting excited about this project. I've been thinking we could use your love for improvisation in the bird sounds too. What do you think?\n\nPeter: That sounds fantastic, Noor. I'm really looking forward to it. Let's make sure our gym sessions don't clash, though – I wouldn't want to miss out on any of these discussions!",

Would that work for you?\n\nSamantha: That works perfectly, Noor. Let's bring our laptops and maybe some musical instruments for the meeting under the gazebo trees. And I hope Leo can bring his violin for improvisation.\n\nNoor: Absolutely! I also suggested we collaborate on the bird duet.
