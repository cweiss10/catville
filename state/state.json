Let's discuss it further under the old oak tree tomorrow, after my practice session.\n\nSamantha: Perfect. Bring your chamomile seeds, and let's enjoy a productive afternoon together. And don't forget the street tacos!\n\nDiego: You got it! I'm looking forward to catching up on our projects and health updates too. See you tomorrow.\n\nSamantha: Can't wait, Diego. Your influence is helping me stay fit, by the way.\n\nDiego: Glad to hear that! Maybe we can even do a quick workout before our meeting if you're up for it. Take care, Samantha.",

She appreciates my dedication to this project. Have you tried those street tacos I recommended?\n\nLeo: Not yet, but I heard they're fantastic! Once we finish rehearsing, maybe we can grab some lunch together and catch up on each other's projects. It'd be good to hear more about your knee injury too.\n\nDiego: Sounds like a plan, Leo.
