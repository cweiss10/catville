They plan to meet again soon at the park and celebrate once they finish the cat mural with tacos on Main Street.\n\nAt 11 PM, Andy talks to Peter at a cafe, where he appreciates Peter's contribution of the violins to their cat mural design and mentions his admiration for the work Andy has been doing at the community center. Andy suggests involving more children from the community center in their project and plans to discuss this further during their quadruple date.\n\nAround 2 AM, Peter talks to Andy at home about a new idea for their cat mural - a day dedicated to feeding stray cats under a gazebo while planning and bonding. They agree on this idea, with Peter bringing the sunrise seeds, and mention a hospital piece with Samantha.\n\nAt 5 AM, Peter talks to Samantha at the hospital about plans for a squirrel latte contest with Mei, and they plan brainstorming sessions, suggesting Main Street Tacos for dinner tomorrow. Peter proposes coordinating their meeting with Leo's suggested time at Main Street Tacos and bringing noise-cancelling headphones for focus. Samantha agrees, and she suggests that Leo's violin could add charm under the gazebo trees.\n\nIn addition to this, around 8 AM, Andy proposes having a brainstorming session and quadruple date under the gazebo with Noor before their rehearsal, suggesting they start their project with some street tacos at Main Street Tacos. Peter agrees that it would be a perfect start to their project.",

Peter suggested involving Noor and Andy in the cat mural project as well. Both agreed that the project was taking shape and looked forward to making music and bringing the cats together to create something extraordinary. At the gazebo around 4:00 PM, Leo and Peter reflected on their past busking sessions and reminisced about their start at the cat mural project with Sunrise Seeds. They planned to make a memorable show for the public under the trees, complete with noise-cancelling headphones and snacks. Leo also brought his violin for a possible bird duet with Caroline, as they prepared to kickstart their collaborative efforts on the project.",
