They discussed incorporating hazelnut-cinnamon squirrel lattes, sunrise seeds, and a cat mural into their plans. Caroline also reminded Leo about the duet under the gazebo trees, feeding the stray cats tomorrow, and Leo bringing his violin to Main Street Tacos for tonight's quadruple date.\n\nCaroline later spoke with Noor at home around 11:00 AM, discussing their cat mural project. They planned to meet at Main Street Tacons this afternoon at 4 PM to further discuss the design and invited Diego to participate. They also agreed to have a quadruple date tonight before starting their creative session under the gazebo trees tomorrow. Caroline mentioned Leo bringing his violin and Noor promised to bring treats for the stray cats as well.",

Speaking of which, I heard you and Samantha are planning a cat mural – have you decided on any designs yet?\n\nCaroline: That's right! Samantha suggested incorporating sunrise seeds into the design, but we could use your pragmatic eye for detail to help finalize it. We were also thinking of having Peter join us with his violin. Have you talked to him about it?\n\nDiego: I did indeed! He's on board and even suggested a double date with Mei and Noor for our quadruple date. Seems like we're all set for an exciting day under the gazebo trees, don't you think?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely, Diego. I can't wait to perform one of my tunes afterwards – maybe it will inspire some ideas for the mural! Let's make sure we bring enough treats for the stray cats as well. You know, I spoke with Noor last night about the project and she seems very excited.\n\nDiego: That's great to hear. I chatted with Peter about the cat mural too – he's been working on that algorithm for us, remember? We should update each other on our progress later today at the park during our pre-gazebo stretch session, right?\n\nCaroline: You got it, Diego! See you in a few hours.

I can't wait to perform one of my tunes afterwards – maybe it will inspire some ideas for the mural! Let's make sure we bring enough treats for the stray cats as well.

Speaking of which, did we confirm our meeting with Samantha today at Main Street Tacos?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely! I can't wait to see what we come up with. And I've got a surprise for you – Diego suggested involving his birds in the squirrel latte contest. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That sounds amazing! But remember, my old knee might not be able to keep up if we run after dinner. Let's save that for tomorrow instead. How about we grab a quick bite first, then hit the park with the birds?\n\nCaroline: You're right, Noor. Let's take it easy on your knee. Sounds like a plan – I'll bring my violin too! I can't wait to see what tonight brings.",
