I'm glad we can blend our passions in this collaborative effort. Let's finalize the details this weekend at the park event.\n\nMei: By the way, I spoke with Andy and Caroline about our project too. They're excited to join our brainstorming session tomorrow.\nSamantha: That's wonderful news! I can't wait to discuss my idea for the performance and hear their suggestions over coffee.\n\nSamantha: And speaking of collaboration, I wanted to ask if you'd be open to working together on the cat mural? I think incorporating Leo's squirrel tune could add a nice touch.\nMei: Absolutely! Peter's book arrived, so we can start sketching designs tonight. Let's make El Charro's creative landscape truly unique.",

They also discussed the plans at El Charro on Thursday. Later that night, Diego spoke to Andy at the library around 12:00 AM, where he invited him to finalize their plans for the cat seeds project over dinner after their yoga session. Andy agreed and brought his sketchbook to capture the ambiance at Main Street Tacos. Finally, Diego also talked to Leo at a train station around 2:00 AM, where they discussed the quadruple date further.

Yes, and it seems we both have a common theme - squirrel tunes. How's the collaboration with Mei on the cat feeding station at El Charro coming along?\"\n\nSamantha: \"It's going well. We're incorporating the squirrel song into our mural design, just as you suggested. Have you managed to get Leo on board for your performance idea?\"\n\nNoor: \"Not yet, but I'll ask him at today's robotics club meeting. Maybe we can combine our creative efforts for a unique park event!\"",

Let's get him involved, I think it could really elevate our work. And speaking of Caroline, have you talked to her about Diego's squirrel tunes at the park? She has some noise-cancelling headphones that might come in handy.\n\nAndy: Yes, we discussed it! She said she'd bring them tomorrow for the yoga session. By the way, I met Mei today and we exchanged seeds for stray cats. We're meeting at Main Street Tacos tonight to discuss more about the mural design, including incorporating Leo's squirrel song.\n\nNoor: That's fantastic! I'll see you both there then. And Andy, you know how much I appreciate your mentorship and creativity. This project is going to be something special.\n\nAndy: I couldn't agree more, Noor.
