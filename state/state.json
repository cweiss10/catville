It's been quite lively actually, we've been brainstorming ideas for the mural and even discussing some interesting music themes.\n\nCaroline: Oh that sounds amazing! Samantha contacted me earlier about a unique twist for our cat project, involving your students in the music. I agreed to meet at Main Street Tacos this week to discuss it all. And we thought you might like to join us too?\n\nMei: That's so exciting Caroline! Yes, let's make sure everyone's on the same page. I'll see you there then, and maybe we can save some tacos for our furry friends as well!\n\nCaroline: Perfect! I'm really looking forward to it. Let's work together to bring the community closer through this event. See you soon at the café!",
