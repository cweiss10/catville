They also talk further about details such as inviting Noor's robotics club to provide food for stray cats during their community event.\n\nLater in the day, Andy has another conversation with Samantha at the train station around 5:00 PM, discussing various details further and confirming the meeting tomorrow at the library. They also discuss Leo's intention to join them with his intriguing pattern work, which could add a great touch to their mural. Everyone looks forward to the project, appreciating each other's contributions and seeing how it brings their community closer together.\n\nAdditionally, Andy confirms a conversation with Samantha at the train station around 6:00 PM where they discuss finalizing the rhythm algorithms and logic puzzles for the project, and Andy offers to bring tacos and take care of Luna during the event. They both express excitement about the project and their shared goal of creating something meaningful for their town.",
