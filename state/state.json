He also encountered Samantha who complimented his violin playing, mentioned Mei's gathering under the old oak tree the following day where he plans to share musical ideas, and shared that Peter and Andy are working on a new collaboration involving sunrise seeds. In their conversation, Peter suggested gathering chamomile for stray cats before meeting and inquired about Leo's violin playing progress for their double date. Leo responded positively and mentioned his improvisations with birds at the park. They agreed to see each other under the old oak tree and look forward to their creative gathering.",
