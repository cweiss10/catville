At 5:00 PM, Caroline talks to Peter at the theater, discussing cat mural project updates, including collaborations with Noor's students, potential involvement of Leo in the project, and planning another quadruple date to discuss further details. Around 6:00 PM, Caroline talks to Peter at the theater about meeting at Main Street Tacos to discuss the cat mural project and Peter's bird duet ideas. Around 8:00 PM, Caroline talks to Noor at a restaurant, discussing the cat mural project and their planned quadruple date, and inquiring about Noor's school robotics this semester.",

Samantha, Mei, Noor, and others propose meetings at the gazebo or Main Street Tacos tomorrow, looking forward to collaborating on this exciting project for their town, with Noor planning to provide snacks for any students who might drop by during their mural session.",
