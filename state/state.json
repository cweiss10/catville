Leo also meets Samantha at school who proposes collaborating on the mural project.\n\nIn the evening, Leo picks up his coffee from Caroline's café and they discuss their musical plans for that night, including an improv session and squirrel duet at the park. Caroline mentions coordinating schedules for a double date with Diego and Noor, which Leo confirms will be on Sunday. They also plan to feed stray cats together prior to their meetings.\n\nLater in the night, Leo talks to Diego about the double date, squirrel song, mural project, and potential additions like a yoga corner and zine club friends' performance. They agree to meet before their mural project meeting on Tuesday at El Charro.\n\nAt 6:00 AM the next day, Leo encounters Samantha at the gym. She proposes collaborating on the mural project and suggests incorporating logic puzzles into the design, which Leo agrees to help with over coffee at El Charro the following morning. Samantha also invites Andy to their meeting, as he has ideas for the yoga aspects in the cat nook.",
