By the way, did you hear about the sunrise seeds for my amp sketch?\n\nSamantha: Yes, it sounds intriguing. I've already planned to bring my headphones and a blanket for our taco meeting tonight. Diego has been working on mural ideas as well, so we should be ready.\n\nNoor: Perfect! I can't wait to share the chamomile tea with you and the strays. And don't forget to discuss Leo's amp idea with Andy at Main Street Tacos this weekend. Let's make our town more vibrant together!",

I'll bring my headphones tomorrow under the oak tree so we can finalize it together.

Andy agreed, offered to bring chamomile tea for Diego's cats, discussed an early-morning run with Diego the next day, and suggested a meeting with Samantha under the old oak tree that night to discuss mural details. They also planned on using sunrise seeds from the theater in their community garden. Both parties looked forward to making the project a memorable week for their arts in the park.\n\nIn a later conversation at a cafe around 7:00 PM, Leo shared his idea of a sunrise symphony with Samantha and discussed collaborating with Diego on stretching under the old oak tree the next day. They agreed to bring chamomile tea for the strays and were excited about creating magic together.\n\nIn another conversation at 2:00 AM, Leo and Andy discussed using Peter's violin in the cat mural and rehearsing under the old oak tree the following day.
