It was suggested that Leo could contribute his melodies to the mechanical bird project during a conversation with Samantha at the market. Both women agreed to meet under the old oak tree this weekend to discuss further and Samantha also agreed to help them with city sounds for the project and potentially join their zine club.\n\nAndy informed Caroline in a hospital conversation that Samantha had agreed to help them, suggesting they catch up tonight at the theater for Andy's gig. In another conversation at school, Andy confirmed he has sketches ready for their meeting tomorrow.\n\nDuring their exchange, Andy shared with Caroline that Samantha will be bringing her headphones for a focused work session under the old oak tree tomorrow. Caroline suggested expanding the ritual to include the cat mural theme from their zine club and invited everyone involved, including Diego and herself. She proposed making Leo's kitten the charming mascot for the event and reiterated their chamomile latte tradition.\n\nCaroline shared with Andy that she had proposed expanding the ritual to Mei at the theater earlier today and they planned to invite Peter to help with bird design and melodies. Both were excited about the collaborative projects and looked forward to making them a success under the old oak tree.\n\nIn an early morning conversation at town hall, Caroline invited Leo to join their hospital meeting and he agreed to attend, bringing potential tunes that could inspire healing. In a home conversation today, Samantha suggested inviting Peter to both projects, which was agreed upon by Caroline and they also agreed to send him an invitation. Both women expressed excitement about the collaborations and the positive impact they would have on their lives.\n\nIn a new conversation at town hall, Andy discusses their plans for tomorrow with Caroline and mentions Noor's suggestion to involve Samantha's students in the project, looks forward to the tea party under the old oak tree, and suggests practicing latte art together before the big day. They also talk about a gym session before the meeting at the library tonight.",

At 10:00 AM, Peter talked to Noor at a hospital where she mentioned improvements made by her robotics club on the mechanical birds. They shared excitement about revitalizing their town with projects like these, and Peter suggested including Mei and her zine club in the tea party. Diego offered street tacos, while Noor planned on making chamomile lattes. They also discussed incorporating logic puzzles into the afternoon's events.\n\nLater at 12:00 AM, Peter talked to Mei at a hospital and proposed turning their cat mural project into a community event, involving her Saturday zine club. Mei suggested meeting Andy at the market for chamomile lattes to discuss further details and added that Leo could bring his kitten to the tea party. They agreed to make it happen.",
