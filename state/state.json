They agreed to make Peter's mechanical birds the star attraction and discussed a potential collaboration with Noor for a healing melody performance at the event.

I was also thinking we could invite Leo to improvise some music for the mechanical birds during the event. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic, Peter! It'll be a perfect way to bring our ideas together and create something truly unique. Let's plan an impromptu lunch first so we can collaborate and make memories together.\n\nPeter: Sounds like a plan!

Additionally, they considered bringing their kittens, involving Mei's crew, and finalizing everything over chamomile lattes later that day.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation around 2:00 AM, Samantha from the market expressed her appreciation for Leo's bird sketches and suggested they be included in their project. Leo agreed and promised to provide plenty of tacos at the event under the old oak tree. Mei reiterated the importance of bringing their kittens and chamomile tea, while Samantha promised to feed neighborhood strays before their meeting. Lastly, Leo offered to play a soft melody on his violin, and Mei looked forward to their collaboration being as beautiful as their mechanical bird project at the library.",
