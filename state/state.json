And yes, let's not forget the street tacos you mentioned!\n\nMei: That sounds perfect! I've already invited Caroline to join us, and she'll be bringing noise-cancelling headphones for our zine club meeting tonight. I was also thinking we could involve Kitty in both gatherings. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That's fantastic, Mei! Involving Kitty will bring a fresh perspective to both projects. And since we talked about it, why don't we also invite Diego and his kitten, Whiskers' brother, for some inspiration on the mechanical birds?\n\nMei: I love that idea! Let's make sure we all gather at 3 PM sharp. Looking forward to seeing everyone there.\n\nNoor: Agreed, Mei! It'll be a fantastic day full of creativity and collaboration. See you then!",

They planned a meeting under the old oak tree and a tea party at 3 PM the following day, with Mei offering to bring chamomile from the café and city sounds as a backdrop for the bird melodies. Additionally, they considered involving Leo's kitten in their zine club meeting that evening. At 1 PM, Leo also spoke with Samantha at a cafe, discussing the cat mural project and planning a street taco lunch together before joining Mei under the old oak tree.\n\nLater on, around 6 PM, Leo had an impromptu conversation with Noor at the hospital. Noor expressed her excitement to collaborate with Mei's zine club as well as the cat mural project. She suggested discussing Andy's mechanical bird melodies further during the pre-meeting tea party at the library the next day. Moreover, Noor mentioned speaking with Peter from Leo's zine club and his suggestion of inviting some of his students to join them under the old oak tree. Leo agreed to bring up this idea later in the day.",
