Later, Andy spoke with Noor at the hospital who expressed interest in collaborating by incorporating her flowers into the mechanical birds project.

Andy shared the new idea of incorporating city sounds into their mural and suggested using Mei's students for the festivities under the old oak tree. Peter was excited about these ideas and proposed involving Leo to help with the bird melodies in the cat mural, making it a more cohesive project.
