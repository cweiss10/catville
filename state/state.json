In the new conversation at 9:00 AM, Caroline talks to Leo at the market. She asks about his new tune for their upcoming tea party and he reveals it's inspired by city night sounds. They discuss collaborating more often and potentially doing a duet. At 10:00 AM, Caroline speaks with Samantha at the hospital. Samantha appreciates Caroline's latte art and shares her fascination for Mei's mechanical bird patterns in the mural project. She suggests incorporating noise-cancelling headphones to make it more unique. Caroline proposes collaborating on the project and meeting up the next day at the mural site with treats for the cats.",
