In the late night, Mei meets up with Leo under the old oak tree, discussing his new duet partner and the upcoming meeting with Noor's robotics club at the zine club.\n\nAt 1:00 AM, Mei talks to Andy at a restaurant about the mural project. They discuss coordinating a joint session under the old oak tree the next day and agree to include chamomile tea for the cats as suggested by Caroline. Furthermore, they talk about Caroline showcasing her latte art skills at their event. They both express excitement about making a difference in the town with this project and agree to work together to make it special.",
