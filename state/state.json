In a later conversation, Andy asked Diego about outfits for their upcoming double date on Thursday at Main Street Tacos, to which Diego suggested crisp shirts and jeans.\n\nDiego then talked to Noor at a cafe around 1:00 PM. He was excited about her joining the mural project and they agreed to meet at El Charro before Tuesday's project meeting to plan things out. They also discussed the double date plans, musical element in the cat nook, and the new taco spot on Main Street for their double date. Noor suggested inviting Caroline as well.",
