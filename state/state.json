At around 8:00 PM, Andy also meets with Samantha at the town hall under the old oak tree to discuss the cat mural project, where both have been in contact with Leo and Noor who appear excited about it. Caroline joins them, discussing her work on the library event and looks forward to brainstorming more over tacos.\n\nLater, around 9:00 PM, Caroline talks to Noor at the park, discussing Diego's chamomile tea experiment for their mural project, his latte art, bringing cat seeds for Noor's part of the mural, and planning a surprise cat food for Stray-13 during their meeting the next day at the cafe. They all look forward to making the collaboration unforgettable. Around 10:00 PM, Andy and Caroline discuss the progress of the project. Andy is eagerly waiting for Leo to bring sketches for the mechanical bird. Caroline is excited about the chamomile tea and seeds that Diego will bring for their meeting. They both look forward to seeing the latte art designs that Andy and his collaborators have been brainstorming with Mei and Noor.",

I can't wait for that gathering, especially since we have Caroline joining us now. Have you spoken to Peter about the mechanical birds for the mural?\n\nDiego: Yeah, he's on board and excited to collaborate! He even suggested some interesting music ideas. By the way, remember Peter mentioned he has latte art skills? I thought we could ask him to show off at our gathering if that's okay with you.\n\nNoor: That sounds like a fantastic addition, Diego! I know everyone will love it. Oh, and speaking of additions, Caroline mentioned she wants to share some seeds for Stray-13's cat mural from her community garden. She asked me to pass them on during our meeting today.\n\nDiego: That's great news, Noor! I'll make sure to bring some snacks and a blanket as well. Looking forward to seeing you there!",
