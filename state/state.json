They discussed plans for chamomile lattes in the mural garden and Mei's excitement about mechanical birds.\n\nLater, around 6:00 AM, Andy talked to Mei at the market, suggesting a meeting under the old oak tree the following day at 5 PM. They agreed to bring chamomile lattes and seeds for Caroline's garden, aiming to make it a special evening.\n\nAt 9:00 AM, Andy spoke to Diego at the hospital, where Diego expressed interest in the collaboration. They discussed the potential incorporation of mechanical birds into the mural and the possibility of a city sounds project.\n\nAround 10:00 AM, Andy met up with Diego at the park, inviting him to join their cat mural collaboration under the old oak tree that evening. Diego agreed, bringing seedlings for the community garden and looking forward to the discussion, tea, tacos, and possible duet.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, Andy talked to Noor at the hospital, inviting her to join their cat mural project with her robotic elements, which she accepted.
