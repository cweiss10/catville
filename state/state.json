Caroline agrees, proposes they catch up at the café window before finalizing the design, and suggests running through the park together beforehand. The meeting with Caroline takes place around 6 AM at a cafe. Andy proposes incorporating constellations and sunrise seeds into the mural, which Caroline thinks Samantha could complement with ideas. They plan a double date with tacos and cat chamomile tea.\n\nLater, Caroline mentions that Leo suggested incorporating Samantha's violin into the mural design to create a sunrise symphony. Andy agrees and plans to involve Diego, Mei, and set up their double date soon. He has some chamomile tea for stray cats ready. Additionally, Andy suggests inviting Samantha to the brainstorming session on Thursday.",
