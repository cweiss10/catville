They plan to meet at Main Street Tacos at 2 PM the following day for a joint meeting about their projects, followed by potential discussions at the gazebo trees. Mei reminded Andy to bring seeds from her garden and promised snacks for the cats.\n\nMei spoke with Noor at the museum around 5 AM and discussed Noor's jam session with Caroline. They also looked forward to discussing interactive elements of their projects, feeding strays under the gazebo that night, and meeting up later. Noor agreed to do her stretches for a knee injury as suggested by Mei.\n\nDiego mentioned running into Samantha the previous night and planning to catch up over lunch after their workouts that day, inviting Noor to join them for some street tacos and project sharing. Noor accepted the invitation and looked forward to seeing them both after her workout.\n\nMei met with Peter at a cafe around 6 AM and discussed their plans further. Peter mentioned that Caroline found sunrise seeds for the gazebo trees, and Mei was impressed by his workout success as shared by Samantha. They were excited about collaborating on the project and appreciated each other's dedication.\n\nLater in the day, Mei and Peter agreed to meet at the gazebo that night at 6 PM to discuss ideas for the bird duet design, involving Leo and Diego's suggestions for gym routines. They planned to have dinner at Main Street Tacos beforehand and share cat treats with the stray cats as part of their community project.",
