Both parties express excitement and discuss their dedication to the community garden.\n\nAround 8:00 AM, Leo talks to Caroline at the town hall, who proposes a new idea for their collaboration - a sunrise symphony. He agrees and proposes bringing tacos as a treat for the stray cats after the meeting. The participants look forward to their collaboration meeting under the old oak tree the following day, also discussing the possibility of a morning run before the meeting.\n\nLater in the day, Leo talks to Samantha at school and discusses the violin design with her under the old oak tree. They also talk about feeding stray cats, with Samantha mentioning that she feeds Stray-13 behind the cafe. Leo shares his favorite stray cat, which is the one that serenades him with bird songs at the park.
