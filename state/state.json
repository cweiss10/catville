Diego suggested noise-cancelling headphones during their gazebo brainstorming sessions, which Andy agreed upon.\n\nToday, Andy spoke to Peter at the gym about the cat mural collaboration, planning to discuss more details over dinner tonight at Main Street Tacos. He later talked to Noor at the theater who suggested incorporating sunrise seeds in their design. They decided to meet under the gazebo tomorrow at 5 PM to discuss further, bringing snacks for everyone including the EMTs who help out at the park.\n\nAndy also spoke to Diego at the hospital again and discussed incorporating some latte art elements into the cat mural design. They planned a warm-up session in the morning before their meeting and agreed to meet early tomorrow.\n\nLater, Caroline suggested adding science elements to the cat mural which both Andy and Diego liked.
