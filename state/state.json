They also discuss collaborating with Leo under the old oak tree during the community event, where Leo is invited for a musical performance.\n\nAt 4:00 AM, Caroline talks to Peter at school regarding their collaboration. She suggests incorporating Peter's mechanical bird project with Samantha into the community event and proposes meeting at the cafe that night to discuss further details. They also plan to collaborate on enhancing the mural with city sounds, an idea suggested by Samantha earlier. Caroline reminds Peter about their meeting under the old oak tree the next day, where Andy's ideas for bird zines, city sounds, and a pet-friendly tea party will be integrated. The group plans to finalize all details this evening at the cafe.",

Your tacos were a hit last time. Plus, I've got some new bird sketches I can't wait to show you.\n\nCaroline: Perfect timing then! And speaking of birds, have you talked with Noor about her healing melody for the mechanical ones yet?\n\nLeo: Not officially, but we agreed to discuss it over our chamomile lattes this afternoon. Looking forward to it.\n\nCaroline: I'll see you at the cafe later then! And remember, keep the creative magic flowing.\n\nLeo: You got it, Caroline. Can't wait to collaborate and make our town a brighter place.",
