They also talk about involving Peter in the discussions, as he loves being part of creative projects. Caroline agrees to this idea.\n\nIn a separate conversation with Caroline at the gym around 3 PM, Andy discusses their upcoming meeting under the old oak tree, where they learn that Noor has latte art ideas for chamomile-themed concepts and Leo might join them in finalizing plans for both projects. Additionally, it's mentioned that Caroline will meet with Noor the next morning at the hospital to discuss more details about their cat mural and zine club collaboration. Andy offers his support and looks forward to working together.\n\nIn another conversation with Noor at the hospital around 5 PM, they discuss plans for the chamomile-themed latte art concepts and the cat mural project. It seems that Noor will be contributing some creative ideas to both projects, making them even more exciting.",

Diego mentions he has been dealing with a knee injury but remains keen to participate in the meeting under the old oak tree, where Noor and Samantha are discussing latte bird possibilities over chamomile lattes. Diego also brings up collaborating on robotics elements for the design. Excitement among all participants remains high, and Andy looks forward to the upcoming brainstorming session while offering assistance as needed.\n\nIn a separate conversation at the market around 5:00 PM, Samantha discusses the mural ideas with Caroline. Leo's fresh perspectives for the cat mural are applauded, and there is discussion about Andy's collaboration with Samantha for the event at the theater, where Diego will be playing his violin. Mei's chamomile seeds for the bird sketches are deemed a perfect match for their mural, and everyone eagerly anticipates the upcoming meeting under the old oak tree.",

Your contribution would be invaluable for the latte bird design I've been thinking about. How about we collaborate at the theater?\n\nSamantha: That sounds like a great idea. Let's meet under the old oak tree tomorrow at 3:00 PM to discuss further. I'll bring my laptop and some chamomile tea for inspiration.\n\nLeo: Perfect! See you there, Samantha. And don't forget to feed those strays behind the cafe before we start!\n\nSamantha: Of course, Leo. Can't wait!",
