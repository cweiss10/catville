Noor agrees and offers to bring snacks for everyone, including Peter and the EMTs.

At each meeting, they discussed expanding their cat mural project, involving more people such as Andy, Leo, Mei, Peter, Noor, and Diego in the project. They also planned to incorporate stray cat feeding into their next rehearsal and a squirrel latte contest with Leo and Caroline. Furthermore, Caroline invited her cafe friends to help out with cat treats, and Diego expressed interest in trying Mei's squirrel latte art.\n\nAt the 6:00 PM train station meeting, Samantha invited Mei to join them for some latte art brainstorming post-project. Mei agreed, suggesting they bring noise-cancelling headphones and mentioned that Leo's violin could be a perfect addition to their gathering under the gazebo trees. Later in the day, Samantha approached Mei at the museum around 7:00 PM and proposed a collaboration on the cat mural project. Mei agreed and suggested meeting at Main Street Tacos around 7 PM the next day for further discussion, where they would bring noise-cancelling headphones and discuss over dinner before diving into the details of the mural.",

Everyone agrees to contribute new ideas to their cat mural project and stray cat feeding efforts, with potential incorporation of music into these events, especially a mini bird duet suggested by Caroline between her and Leo.\n\nLeo proposes a warm-up session at Main Street Tacos tonight at 8 PM, which Caroline accepts. In an additional conversation with Leo at the gym, Caroline suggests inviting him to play the violin during their cat feeding session under the gazebo trees on Sunday. Leo enthusiastically agrees to this collaboration and proposes a bird duet between them.\n\nSamantha secured some sunrise seeds from Peter for their hospital piece, and Caroline has finalized treats for the cats on Sunday, inviting her cafe friends to help out. Diego expresses interest in trying Mei's squirrel latte art, while Caroline shares Andy's sketches for the cat mural with Leo, who thinks they're amazing and looks forward to their collaboration.\n\nIn another conversation, Caroline talks to Peter at school around 7 PM, where she is excited about Peter joining their cat mural project and discusses a potential quadruple date beforehand. Peter suggests using the sunrise seeds for the design and expresses gratitude for inviting Mei for stray cat feeding. They both look forward to connecting more with everyone on this project.",
