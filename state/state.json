Andy proposes a meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow at 10 AM, with Leo bringing his violin and everyone attending with their art materials. They agree to discuss further and meet up for street tacos after, just like old times, with tea provided by Andy. Diego plans to see Andy later at the gym. The group remains collectively enthusiastic about their upcoming projects.\n\nLater in the day, Andy talks to Peter at the library around 9 PM and asks if he has managed to get the chamomile tea for their meeting tomorrow. Peter confirms that he picked some up from Caroline's and mentions that Mei and Samantha are also excited about the collaboration. Andy suggests that Leo's latte art ideas should blend well with their cat mural. Both Andy and Peter agree that this project is going to bring magic to their town's creative scene, and they express their excitement for seeing each other tomorrow. The conversation ends with Peter stating that it's always a pleasure collaborating with Andy.",
