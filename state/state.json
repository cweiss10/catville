They agreed to meet under the old oak tree in the evening. Andy was excited about bringing Kitty.\n\nCaroline later proposed a collaboration with Diego to finalize designs and suggested a joint bird duet at the community garden this Saturday, with street tacos planned. Both parties expressed excitement about the growing collaboration.\n\nAt 10:00 AM, Caroline discussed the tea party plans again with Andy at the hospital. They both looked forward to the meeting under the old oak tree and the creativity of Andy's students and Diego joining in. Andy also complimented Caroline's latte art and anticipation for their coffee meeting with Peter later that day, which would lead to the creation of a cat mural masterpiece. The human then had another conversation with Andy at the cafe around 11:00 AM.",

They plan to meet under the oak tree the following day for further discussions, with street tacos as fuel for creativity.\n\nDiego accepts Caroline's invitation to her tea party on Saturday for the cat mural project gathering, offering his help in finalizing designs and collaborating on the bird duet. Mei informs Diego about the students making mechanical birds, suggesting adding Leo's kitten to the event. They plan to discuss these ideas at their meeting under the oak tree that evening.\n\nLeo, in a subsequent conversation at the museum around 7:00 PM, invites Diego to meet at the community garden that night to discuss and potentially collaborate on the mechanical bird sketches, also mentioning chamomile lattes. He proposes involving Mei's zine club for a unique twist, and informs Diego that Noor is bringing snacks for everyone, including those from Leo's robotics club. Additionally, Leo plans to bring his kitten along. Diego agrees, looking forward to creating something special for their town and ensuring Whiskers' brother's designs are ready for review before the meeting.\n\nPeter, who they have been working with on the mural, talks to Diego at the gym around 3:00 AM. Peter updates Diego about his work with Andy and Caroline on the design, mentioning the addition of mechanical bird duets. Diego invites Leo to their meeting under the oak tree to collaborate further on the mechanical birds. Peter agrees, expressing enthusiasm for this collaboration as they make a good team, and suggests adding Whiskers' little brother into the design for a touch of fun. They both look forward to working together that day.",
