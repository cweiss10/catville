Yes, it's going well. Looking forward to discussing those mechanical bird melodies with Samantha. By the way, I suggested involving Diego's kitten for inspiration too. How was your meeting with Leo about the cat mural project?\n\nAndy: It went great! We even invited Peter and Caroline for a tea party under the old oak tree tomorrow. Hope you two can join as well!\n\nNoor: That sounds lovely, Andy. Can't wait to see what we create together. Let's make sure not to miss each other's sessions, alright?\n\nAndy: Agreed, Noor. Here's to a successful project and a wonderful friendship!",

And yes, let's not forget the street tacos you mentioned!\n\nMei: That sounds perfect!

What do you think?\n\nNoor: That's fantastic, Mei! Involving Kitty will bring a fresh perspective to both projects. And since we talked about it, why don't we also invite Diego and his kitten, Whiskers' brother, for some inspiration on the mechanical birds?\n\nMei: I love that idea! Let's make sure we all gather at 3 PM sharp. Looking forward to seeing everyone there.\n\nNoor: Agreed, Mei! It'll be a fantastic day full of creativity and collaboration. See you then!",
