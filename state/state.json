Diego agrees and suggests discussing details after his morning workout tomorrow over fresh mint tea. Mei plans to bring chamomile lattes for lunch during the mural garden project discussion as well. Diego offers to stretch with them after their meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow, which Mei accepts.",
