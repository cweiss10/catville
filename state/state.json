She also discusses the progress of the cat mural labels involving Noor's robotics club and schedules another coffee meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow to further discuss these details.\n\nMei meets Andy at the library around 8:00 PM, where they plan to meet under the gazebo trees tonight to discuss their collaboration on the mural. Mei expresses excitement about Andy's bird duet idea with Samantha and agrees to join them for lunch at Main Street Tacos tomorrow.\n\nIn a new conversation with Samantha at the library around 6:00 AM, they exchange cat food and seeds, discuss their interactive tree idea, and robotics elements, and plan to meet for coffee at Main Street Tacos before delving into the details of the project.\n\nPeter suggests his tech skills could make Mei's interactive tree idea shine and offers to work together on it, possibly applying the same principles for the cat mural. They plan to meet at Main Street Tacos at 4 PM today to discuss further details and brainstorm ideas, with Mei bringing her sketchbook.",

She had already started working on robotics elements for the tree project and brought cat food for the stray cats. They planned to catch up more on their projects at the old oak tree later.\n\nAround 4:00 AM, Diego talked to Caroline at the market where he mentioned his plans for a mural project with Noor, involving Andy. He also discussed the robotics ideas for the tree and squirrel latte art designs for their community celebration, as well as bringing cat food for the strays. Caroline reminded him about Leo's upcoming performance and their potential jam session afterwards, asking them to keep it low-key so the theater guard doesn't find out.
