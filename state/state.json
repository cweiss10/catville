And since we're discussing collaborations, have you talked to Caroline about incorporating chamomile seeds from her market into our mural? We could meet up at the café on Thursday at 3 PM to discuss further.\n\nNoor: Yes, I did mention it to Caroline at the market last night. She's excited to collaborate and even suggested a logic puzzle for the mural!
