Peter talks to Caroline at the museum around 5:00 AM about the upcoming running event, taco feast, and meeting with Diego under the old oak tree. They also plan a double date at the library for detailed planning.\n\nIn further discussions, Mei talks to Caroline at home around 7:00 AM. They discuss the shared enthusiasm for the project and its intertwined creative endeavors, such as the sunrise run, cat mural project under the oak tree, and Leo's violin performance. They also talk about setting out chamomile tea for the cats before their meeting and bringing street tacos as a treat after the event. Mei reminds Caroline about the importance of stretching before the run, and they agree to make sure their creative journey is harmonious like their music.",
