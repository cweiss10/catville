Maybe next time you play, we could collaborate on something? Like one of those algorithms I've been working on.\n\nLeo: That sounds like an interesting challenge! Let's do it. And maybe you can introduce me to your neighborhood strays while we're at it.\n\nSamantha: Deal! I'll see you behind the cafe this evening then?\n\nLeo: Absolutely, looking forward to it. By the way, have you heard about Andy's plan to delve into old archives at the library? We should go together.\n\nSamantha: That sounds like a great idea!
