Caroline also suggests chamomile tea for the stray cats, which they plan to provide.

Later during their conversation around 11:00 AM, Peter thanks Leo for suggesting the collaboration with Diego about the mural and expresses his excitement to hear Leo's bird duets up close. They discuss making chamomile tea for the new feline friends under the old oak tree, agreeing it will be an unforgettable experience.
