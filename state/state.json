How about we keep each other in the loop as things progress?\n\nDiego: Absolutely, let's do that.

They also discuss expanding the sunrise seed idea into their cat mural project and Mei's zine club. Later in the day (3:00 PM), Noor suggests incorporating Leo's bird improvisations during the cat mural unveiling, as well as starting with an impromptu jam at the gazebo and having a symphony under the old oak tree. Leo agrees to these ideas and they decide to keep each other updated on their projects. At around 8:00 PM, Leo talks to Mei at a restaurant, where she suggests that Leo's bird improvisations could be a wonderful addition to their cat mural, which Leo enthusiastically agrees with. Mei proposes that it will be magical under the old oak tree, and Leo agrees, looking forward to a unique evening of music and artistry in their community.",
