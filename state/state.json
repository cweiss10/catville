They also considered incorporating music for stray animals in the park as part of their project, aiming to create a harmonious blend of science and art.\n\nAt 1:00 PM, Leo had a conversation with Mei at the train station. Diego mentioned their upcoming double date at the community garden this weekend, which coincides with Leo's plans discussed with Noor earlier about the mural project involving stray animals. Mei proposed a Saturday zine club meeting at the library where Leo could perform an impromptu violin piece after his busking session. They also talked about Noor's idea to incorporate musical performances into the community garden project, which Leo found intriguing.",
