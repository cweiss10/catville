Both women agreed to meet under the old oak tree this weekend to discuss further and Samantha also agreed to help them with city sounds for the project and potentially join their zine club.\n\nAndy informed Caroline in a hospital conversation that Samantha had agreed to help them, suggesting they catch up tonight at the theater for Andy's gig. In another conversation at school, Andy confirmed he has sketches ready for their meeting tomorrow.\n\nDuring their exchange, Andy shared with Caroline that Samantha will be bringing her headphones for a focused work session under the old oak tree tomorrow. Caroline suggested expanding the ritual to include the cat mural theme from their zine club and invited everyone involved, including Diego and herself. She proposed making Leo's kitten the charming mascot for the event and reiterated their chamomile latte tradition.\n\nCaroline shared with Andy that she had proposed expanding the ritual to Mei at the theater earlier today and they planned to invite Peter to help with bird design and melodies. Both were excited about the collaborative projects and looked forward to making them a success under the old oak tree.",

Caroline, Mei, and Diego discuss the seed gathering ritual for the project, which will take place tomorrow at 1 PM under the old oak tree. They plan to have chamomile lattes beforehand like old times and invite everyone involved, including Diego and Leo's kitten as the charming mascot.\n\nMei talks to Andy at a restaurant around 7 PM, who mentions his thermos filled with fresh mint tea for tonight's meeting. Mei brings chamomile tea as well, looking forward to creating something beautiful together for the project. Later, the human talks to Peter at the hospital around midnight. Peter suggests expanding the cat mural project into a community event and involving the Saturday zine club. He proposes gathering seeds from the community garden before starting on the design and meeting Andy at the market later for chamomile lattes to discuss further. They also discuss turning the event soft with kids at the park, possibly inviting Leo's kitten as well.\n\nThe human talks to Samantha at the market around 2:00 AM, who mentions she plans to bring her cat Paws to join the gathering under the old oak tree. Mei and Samantha discuss details for the cat mural project, with Leo suggesting involving his zine club in collaboration. They arrange a tea party at 3 PM the next day with community center colleagues to gather seeds from the garden before starting on the design, just as Andy suggested.\n\nThe human also talks to Leo at a cafe around 9:00 AM, where they further discuss project details and plans for involving the Saturday zine club in collaboration.",

And yes, let's not forget the street tacos you mentioned!\n\nMei: That sounds perfect! I've already invited Caroline to join us, and she'll be bringing noise-cancelling headphones for our zine club meeting tonight. I was also thinking we could involve Kitty in both gatherings. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That's fantastic, Mei! Involving Kitty will bring a fresh perspective to both projects. And since we talked about it, why don't we also invite Diego and his kitten, Whiskers' brother, for some inspiration on the mechanical birds?\n\nMei: I love that idea! Let's make sure we all gather at 3 PM sharp. Looking forward to seeing everyone there.\n\nNoor: Agreed, Mei! It'll be a fantastic day full of creativity and collaboration. See you then!",

What do you think?\n\nNoor: That's fantastic, Mei! Involving Kitty will bring a fresh perspective to both projects. And since we talked about it, why don't we also invite Diego and his kitten, Whiskers' brother, for some inspiration on the mechanical birds?\n\nMei: I love that idea!
