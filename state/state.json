They discuss various aspects like the cat mural project, potential collaborations with Noor, Caroline's plans for Leo's performance, a possible jam session, and a surprise for the stray cats behind the cafe. Samantha agrees to join them and suggests syncing their performances for the gazebo event. They plan to meet at Main Street Tacos tomorrow along with Mei.\n\nLater in the day around 7:00 PM, Caroline talks to Peter at the park. She proposes a meeting at Main Street Tacos today due to discussing something about their interactive tree project with him and Mei, suggesting they meet at 4 PM instead. She also asks Peter to pick up Diego's headphones from the cafe on his way there.",

Diego has secured the headphones Peter requested and will pick them up from Caroline's cafÃ© before their meeting tomorrow.\n\nPeter arranges a brainstorming session with Mei at Main Street Tacos at 4 PM today, discussing their interest in collaborating on her interactive tree idea for the cat mural project. They agree to work together, and Mei shares that Diego has made progress with a squirrel latte art design. Peter reminds Mei about his seeds for the community garden, and they both look forward to their quadruple date once the project is completed.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, Peter talks to Andy at school, discussing their roles for tonight's rehearsal and reminiscing about their old busking days. Later, Peter also has a conversation with Caroline about their meeting before the workout tomorrow, and they discuss last-minute ideas for the cat mural project, as well as Caroline's upcoming performance. Both appreciate each other's support in making the project successful.\n\nAt 5:00 PM, Peter talks to Mei at a restaurant, discussing plans for their collaboration on the cat mural project and suggesting they meet up before Saturday for gym sessions. They agree to catch up after Andy's rehearsal tonight, and both look forward to sharing quiet spaces to prepare for their roles in the project.",

Samantha and Mei discuss cat food, seeds, interactive tree ideas, robotics elements, and plan a coffee meeting at Main Street Tacos before delving into details. Peter offers to work together on the interactive tree idea and suggests his tech skills could make it shine.\n\nDuring a cafe meeting, Peter inquires about Mei's progress on the cat mural, brings up Diego's squirrel latte art theme, and they discuss ongoing project details, planning to meet at Main Street Tacos at 4 PM today for further discussions. Mei reminds Peter not to forget his seeds for the community garden, and they look forward to their collaboration and a future quadruple date once the project is complete.\n\nIn additional conversations, Mei invites Diego to discuss the squirrel latte art idea at the gazebo tomorrow, and they also plan to catch up on cat food for strays. They confirm plans to practice bird duets with Leo before Tuesday and agree to meet at their usual taco spot tomorrow, with Diego bringing his knee brace.\n\nMei meets Peter at a restaurant around 5:00 PM to discuss their collaboration, and they plan to catch up over gym sessions before Saturday. Peter suggests meeting after Andy's rehearsal tonight as a quiet space for preparation.\n\nMei also talks to Peter at the theater around 9:00 PM, accepting his invitation to collaborate on the cat mural at Main Street Tacos at 4 PM today.",
