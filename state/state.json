They plan to meet under the old oak tree the next day, bringing snacks and possibly street tacos. At 11:00 PM, Andy talks to Caroline at a cafe where he appreciates her latte art inspired by his cat mural sketches. Caroline presents her mechanical bird design for the mural, and they agree to meet under the old oak tree the next day, hoping their musical collaboration with Leo goes smoothly. Caroline suggests finding more time for impromptu duets, and they both look forward to making magic happen together.",

Caroline confirms they will present their ideas there, including the mechanical bird design for the cat mural project.

Caroline assures him she has extra mint leaves for Peter's tea. Noor shares her positive experience with chamomile in her latte and mentions incorporating her robotic birds into the city sounds project at the gym.

Have you thought more about those mechanical bird designs?\n\nLeo: Absolutely, Caroline! I've been working on them. How about we combine your latte art and my mechanical birds during the collaboration under the oak tree in the park?\n\nCaroline: That sounds fantastic! I think it would be a perfect blend of our talents. Let's make sure to catch up with Noor there too, as she has some ideas for her robotic birds.\n\nLeo: Brilliant idea! Maybe we can even have an impromptu duet, Noor and I, under the sunrise sketch. Looking forward to it!",
