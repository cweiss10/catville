The following night, Leo met Noor and Mei under the old oak tree and discussed the sunrise symphony for the mural, involving Mei's addition of sunrise seeds and plans for a double date at Main Street Tacos before working on the cat mural together. These conversations indicate that all three projects aim to bring the town closer together, and Leo expresses optimism about these collaborations leading to something special.",
