I've also invited Diego to join us today. We can share ideas and make this community event a success.\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect! I already reached out to Andy, Leo, and Mei for music. We should have quite an interesting creative session together.\n\nPeter: Indeed. And I think involving Samantha in our discussions about chamomile tea for the stray kitties would be a great idea too, if you agree?\n\nNoor: Absolutely!

He also mentioned inviting Diego, Caroline, and more team members for a discussion under the gazebo the day after.\n\nLater, Andy suggested incorporating Leo's violin melodies into the cat mural project during a conversation at the train station around 12:00 PM with Leo. They agreed to gather at the old oak tree or the gazebo, and also invited Peter and Mei to join. Both parties looked forward to a grand collaboration under the oak tree.",
