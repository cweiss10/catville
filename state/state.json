The idea was promising to Andy, who looked forward to collaborating with Diego, Leo, Samantha, and possibly Noor. Later that night, around 12:00 AM, Andy spoke with Noor at the gym, discussing their excitement for the project, and she agreed to be involved.\n\nAround 1:00 AM, Andy had a conversation with Caroline about the mural project's robotic design and proposed incorporating her idea for a violin serenade. Caroline suggested collaborating with Peter for the community event, and Andy agreed to help with a cat mural. They planned to meet at the library the next morning.\n\nAround 3:00 AM, Andy spoke with Diego again, confirming his attendance at their meeting under the oak tree that night. They discussed Diego's mechanical bird collaboration with Leo, and both appreciated Diego's suggestion of involving Caroline and Peter in the project.\n\nAt 4:00 AM, Andy talked to Leo at a museum. Andy informed Leo about having to reschedule their meeting at the park due to Samantha's need at the hospital. Leo suggested discussing the city sounds idea for the mechanical birds tomorrow under the oak tree and involving Peter and Mei in the project. Andy agreed to the changes, mentioning that Noor and Diego would also be joining them. They looked forward to the upcoming brainstorming session with Caroline as well.\n\nAround 6:00 AM, Andy talked to Caroline at a restaurant about rescheduling their meeting due to Samantha's hospital visit. They agreed to meet later that day for a meal and discussed their excitement for the project. Around 10:00 AM, Andy spoke with Diego at the museum, suggesting Leo, Noor, and Samantha join in the collaboration, as well as Caroline, Peter, and Mei. They also decided to showcase the mechanical birds at Caroline's open mic night and incorporate stray animals into the project. They planned to coordinate everyone's contributions in their meeting that evening under the oak tree.",
