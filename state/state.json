Andy offers to attend and Noor brings snacks and water for everyone, suggesting they stretch before starting to avoid potential aches.\n\nAndy talks to Noor around 8 PM, discussing the mural project and confirming she'll bring treats for stray animals after their meeting. Noor also mentions bringing noise-cancelling headphones if Diego gets too loud with his squirrel tunes. Andy then talks to Caroline around 9 PM, sharing his enjoyment of a lavender latte inspired by his sunrise sketch and expressing readiness for the fusion arts touch in their mural. They agree to have Noor's students join them for the yoga session before starting on the sunrise scene at Caroline's cafe. The meeting is scheduled for sharp at 7 PM tomorrow, with plans for a great day at the park filled with art creation and enjoyment.",

By the way, Caroline suggested we invite your students for a quick yoga session before we start working on the mural. What do you think?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! Yoga and art could make a wonderful combination. Let's set up a quick meeting at Main Street Tacos this evening to discuss more details, shall we?\n\nAndy: That sounds perfect! I'll bring my thermos of tea as always. See you there!\n\nNoor: Looking forward to it, Andy. Don't forget to try those street tacos while we're at it!",

Leo agrees and suggests Peter brings his self-help books for motivation. Peter also mentions that Leo could compose music inspired by the mural.\n\nLeo also reminds Peter about his new duet for their squirrel-themed performance at the park concert, and Peter looks forward to hearing Caroline's improvisations with birds as well.

We should collaborate on that squirrel song soon.\n\nPeter: Agreed, Leo. The squirrel song might just be the breakthrough we need for the cat art project. Let's discuss it over dinner at El Charro tonight. Say, have you heard about Samantha's plans for strays behind the cafe?\n\nLeo: Yes, I did. She seems quite passionate about animals, and I like that in a partner. By the way, I've been thinking... would you mind if I invite her to our duet tomorrow at the park?\n\nPeter: Not at all, Leo! In fact, I think it'd be great. She could add some lovely harmony to our act. Thanks for looking out for us. Let's make this collaboration count!",
