During a conversation at a cafe around 12:00 PM, Andy discussed their shared plans to include Noor's students in a cat mural event and suggested bringing tea for the party.\n\nIn another discussion at a train station around 1:00 PM, Andy proposed involving Noor's healing melody in the mural garden project. Noor suggested her students could help with Leo's mechanical birds too, and proposed to involve them in Andy's event under the old oak tree. Andy then asked if Noor would bring her kitten as the event mascot, which she agreed to, while also mentioning the need for a safe spot during the seed planting ritual at Mei's garden. Both parties looked forward to making the event memorable.",

By the way, have you set up a safe spot yet for Samantha's new kitten during the seed planting ritual at Mei's garden?\n\nNoor: You got it, Diego. I think we should involve more of your gym-goers in Peter's community garden project too, don't you agree?\n\nDiego: Definitely! Pragmatic approach, always. And before the gathering, let's discuss adding mechanical birds to Leo's performance, just as you mentioned at the park this morning.\n\nNoor: Great minds think alike! You know I've also been thinking about incorporating your cat mural into our event somehow. What do you think?\n\nDiego: That sounds perfect! Let's make it happen, Noor.
