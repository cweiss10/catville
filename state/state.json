At 5:00 PM, Andy speaks to Samantha about her robotics club work, discussing Mei's mechanical bird idea and the cat mural project. Andy invites Samantha to a potluck under the old oak tree the next day at 1 PM, where she agrees to bring tacos.\n\nLater around 6:00 PM, Andy talks to Noor at the museum about the change in meeting time for the cat mural project gathering. Noor informs Andy that they've invited stray cats to join them and are excited to share their ideas. They agree to bring chamomile lattes and tea for both humans and cats, respectively. The gathering will be a memorable day and the collaboration already appears to be paying off, according to Andy.",

Diego, Noor, Andy, and Leo agreed to meet at 1 PM instead of 3 PM, with Andy expressing enthusiasm for the project's blend of art and technology. Peter informed Noor that Diego had adjusted the meeting time to 1 PM as well.\n\nDuring a conversation at the train station, Diego ran into Andy and mentioned their potluck under the oak tree tomorrow, to which Noor expressed interest in joining with spicy street tacos afterwards. Diego also informed Noor about Leo's possible attendance and suggested inviting him to their meeting at Caroline's Cafe tomorrow. Additionally, Noor invited Diego to join the meeting as she believed his robotics ideas would be a great addition to the project.\n\nIn another conversation, Noor talked to Leo at school around 3 PM, where they discussed their upcoming brainstorming session and looked forward to an impromptu performance and spicy tacos afterwards. They also agreed to invite Samantha and Caroline to join the meeting and even considered adopting a stray cat for the mural project. Leo offered to bring chamomile lattes and his kitten as well, looking forward to seeing everyone under the oak tree.",
