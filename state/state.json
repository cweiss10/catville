We're planning to meet at Main Street Tacos this week to work it out further. You and Leo might want to join us, maybe even involve your art students too.\n\nNoor: Sounds like a fantastic idea! I'll definitely check my schedule and get back to you. By the way, did you manage to save some tacos for the neighborhood cats?\n\nPeter: Of course! We've got them waiting on our table.

See you at the smoothie bar.\n\n(After they get their smoothies)\n\nSamantha: Thanks for getting the drinks, Noor. Now, let's focus on that mural.
