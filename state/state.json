They agreed to meet at different times during the day and suggested incorporating Caroline's squirrel latte blend in their friendly competition for the quadruple date.\n\nLeo spoke to various individuals about the cat mural project: Andy, Diego, Samantha (at a train station), and Mei. With Andy, they discussed the squirrel latte contest as a potential fun addition to their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos. Leo then spoke to Diego at the market around 8:00 AM, where they agreed to collaborate on the cat mural project under the gazebo, incorporating violin music, improvisational sessions with birds, and inviting Noor and Andy to join them.\n\nLeo had another conversation with Diego at the library, where Diego expressed interest in the squirrel latte contest and offered to show off his amazing latte designs for the cat mural project. They also made plans to feed stray cats under the gazebo trees before starting the project. Later that day, around 4:00 PM, Leo talked to Mei at school. She had her seeds ready for the gazebo trees and reminded him about bringing his violin for their meeting under the gazebo at sunset. They also discussed feeding stray cats before beginning the project, eagerly looking forward to making music and creating something magical together.\n\nIn addition, Leo talked to Samantha at a train station around 9:00 PM. She informed him that she had finished another open-source project and fed the strays as usual. They discussed their plans for the cat mural project and made arrangements to meet with Diego and Caroline at Main Street Tacos the next day. Leo expressed his excitement about how his violin melodies would contribute to the project, and they agreed to make music together.",
