Andy invited Diego to join him for lunch this weekend to discuss the mural project in detail, and they agreed to catch up after Diego's gym session tomorrow.

What do you think?\n\nMei: That sounds fantastic! I'm sure it'll keep the kids engaged and learning. Speaking of Leo, have you made plans for your double date at the library?\n\nSamantha: Yes, we picked 'The Art of Improvisation' as our first read. Leo mentioned bringing spare parts from his violin case to incorporate into the mural. Have you had a chance to discuss involving Noor in our project yet?\n\nMei: Not yet, but I plan to bring it up at my zine club meeting today. Let's catch up after that and finalize details over coffee at the cafe, like old times.\n\nSamantha: Sounds great!
