Let's keep in touch about the plans. Maybe we can grab some tacos before our meeting at the café, as Caroline suggested?\n\nPeter: That sounds great! Looking forward to it.

Andy suggests aligning their projects to avoid clashing instead of competing with each other. They plan to meet first at Andy's place and discuss bringing Leo's violin for a sunset music event they have discussed earlier. Both parties agree to share progress later in the day and work together on creating something special. Furthermore, Leo promises to update Noor about these plans and mentions that Andy's latte art skills could be useful on their mural project.",
