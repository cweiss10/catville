Meanwhile, Samantha meets up with Leo at the gym around 11:00 PM for a quiet duet before returning to their respective tasks.\n\nDuring school hours of 1:00 AM, Peter expresses his excitement about the improv session under the gazebo trees and mentions that he has brought sunrise seeds for the mural project, appreciating Leo's efforts to create art and strengthen their community. Later in the day, at school around 6:00 AM, Peter talks to Leo about obtaining extra strings for the violin needed for tonight's event under the gazebo trees. Leo shares his collaboration with Samantha on a symphony-like project using sunrise seeds and reminds Peter not to forget the sunrise seeds for the cat mural, both looking forward to making the night memorable.",
