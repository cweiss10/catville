They planned to discuss further at Main Street Tacos the following morning. Mei also inquired about Diego's knee health and he confirmed improvement.\n\nAt the 10:00 AM meeting, Mei proposed a collaboration on the interactive tree idea with Caroline and suggested they meet at Main Street Tacos around 10:30 AM for coffee. Diego agreed to this plan, mentioning he would bring stretches for their discussion. Mei reminded him about treats for neighborhood cats.\n\nLater in the day, Diego spoke to Andy at the museum around 11:00 AM about the cat mural project, and they discussed incorporating sunrise seeds mentioned by Noor into the design. They decided to meet at Main Street Tacos the next day to finalize details. Andy also suggested coordinating a regular feeding ritual for stray cats with Samantha, including Caroline's squirrel latte art performance during the event. Diego agreed and proposed discussing his stretches for their bird duet performance as well.\n\nDuring a conversation at school around 3:00 PM, Diego talked to Noor about a sketch he made for squirrel latte art for the cat mural project, and she expressed enthusiasm. They also discussed involving Noor's robotics club in the project and planned to meet the following day at the gazebo to discuss further details. Noor agreed to bring snacks for the students.\n\nIn addition to these interactions, Diego had a conversation with Mei at the gym around 5:00 PM. Mei gave Diego seeds from her garden for their community plot and reminded him of his commitment to feed the stray cats in the park. They also discussed the small rituals that strengthen their town, including their planned bird duet performance and the feeding ritual for stray cats.",
