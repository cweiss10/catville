They also planned to meet at the cafe the following day to finalize plans over a latte, with Leo expressing excitement for Peter's ideas on improvised instruments.\n\nSamantha, who had been invited to collaborate, was thrilled about it and mentioned her bringing a violin for their double date with Mei. Both Peter and Samantha looked forward to the project, with Peter acknowledging the unity and enthusiasm within the community, hoping to make the project magical.\n\nIn the evening, Andy joined the conversation and invited Samantha to participate in the cat mural project as well. Leo shared his plan to involve Peter in a bird duet at the hospital. They agreed on meeting at 10 PM for chamomile tea with stray cats before the event, and decided to have street tacos together after their shared endeavor.\n\nDuring these conversations, Diego joined the project, offering to add rhythm with his footwork during the musical sunrise under the old oak tree. He appreciated being involved in Leo's projects, which helped keep his mind off his injured knee. The group continued to express excitement and look forward to making magic happen together.",
