Later, they talk to Samantha again at the theater and agree to make it a regular ritual in their town.\n\nAt the park around 3:00 PM, the human talks to Caroline, who suggests meeting with Peter for the squirrel robot project. Leo agrees to work on the cat mural design with her tonight at the gazebo. They also plan to jam with birds at Main Street Tacos as suggested by Noor. Caroline is excited about the collaboration and they agree to meet soon. The new summary now includes this additional conversation with Caroline.",
