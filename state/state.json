On this occasion, Noor and Leo discuss their plans for the upcoming run through the park, reminisce about their past collaborations, and express excitement for their quadruple date under the gazebo trees, where they aim to bring their best creative selves to impress Andy and Samantha.\n\nIn a conversation with Mei at the market, Leo is informed that she has agreed on using sunrise seeds for the cat mural project and suggested incorporating improvisations into their meetings, like the one planned for 8 PM. Leo agrees to bring his violin and chamomile tea, as Andy suggested, and asks about the quadruple date at Main Street Tacos, which Mei confirms with Peter's inclusion and a promise of sunrise seeds for stray cats. During their conversation, they exchange pleasantries regarding the blooming sunrise seeds under the gazebo trees and the enchanting violin duets Leo plans to perform for the cat mural project.\n\nIn addition to these arrangements, Leo catches up with Caroline at the theater around 9:00 AM who offers him coffee before his run, and they discuss the progress of the cat mural project, including Leo's new melody he intends to play under the gazebo and their plans for tonight.",
