I appreciate the reminder about stretching. I should get back to it once we're done here. By the way, have you thought about hosting your zine club at the community center? It might attract more people that way.\n\nMei: That's a wonderful idea! Let me see if we can arrange that for next month. I'm all for making our town stronger with small rituals like yours and mine.

Not bad at all, actually. Managed to squeeze in a few impromptu duets with the pigeons during intermission. Gotta love a supportive audience!\n\nDiego: Ha! That's one of the things I admire about you, Leo. Always finding music where others might only hear noise.\n\nLeo: And that's why I appreciate your discipline, Diego. It keeps me grounded when I get too lost in my own world. Maybe someday you can help me with that old knee injury of yours?\n\nDiego: You got it, Leo. After all, we're not just fellow patrons here; we're partners in keeping each other balanced. Now let's grab those tacos and hit the streets!",
