They discussed setting up a meeting with Noor to plan their stray cat tea station. Andy also proposed meeting the next day at the park during Caroline's sunrise sketch session, sharing thoughts on their symphony rehearsals. Caroline agreed and mentioned bringing fresh coffee for them.\n\nAt 11:00 PM, Caroline talked to Samantha at the theater. Samantha suggested collaborating with Caroline and Noor on musical elements for Diego's mural project. They agreed to meet under the old oak tree where they had started their first collaboration together. Later, they also planned to meet at Main Street Tacos for chamomile tea and discussions, with Caroline promising special lattes for everyone. The conversations show that all parties were eagerly looking forward to their collaborative projects.",

Meanwhile, Noor makes plans with Leo, who has some exciting ideas for the cat mural and reminisces about busking at Main Street Tacos in the past, hinting at potential new melodies and discoveries.",
