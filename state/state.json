Peter contacts Noor at 8:00 AM, proposing they meet under the old oak tree the following day to discuss the squirrel latte design and potentially the cat mural as well.

Caroline suggested some new stretches that I might need to test out on that old oak tree we discussed for the symphony performance. What about you? Any exciting updates from the robotics club?\n\nNoor: Oh, yes! We're experimenting with sunrise seeds in our next project – it could add an interesting rhythm element to our symphony under the gazebo.
