Let's also involve Mei and Samantha's class for the tea party under the old oak tree. It'll be a fun collaboration! But first things first, I should probably get home before the kids wake up.

Later, around 9:00 AM, Leo talked to Andy at the hospital, who expressed excitement about joining the cat mural project discussion and invited Leo to a tea party under the old oak tree, with Leo bringing his violin for some impromptu melodies. At 12:00 PM, Leo spoke with Diego at the museum, where Diego was excited about collaborating on the mechanical bird sketches and suggested involving Mei's zine club in the project. Leo agreed to this and proposed bringing his kitten along. Diego mentioned that he would have Whiskers' brother's designs ready for review.
