He also mentioned a double date with Diego and Samantha. Diego expressed interest in a casual yet stylish outfit for their double date, to which Andy agreed.\n\nAt around 11:00 PM, Andy talks to Noor at the town hall. They discuss her ideas for incorporating robotics into the mural design, agreeing to grab coffee on Thursday morning to discuss further. Noor mentions a fun double date at the cafe and invites Andy to their quadruple date at the library this Saturday, where they will bring some tea for everyone. Andy agrees and mentions a possible double date with Diego and Samantha.\n\nCaroline is contacted by Andy around 12:00 AM at the town hall, and they discuss the mural project. Andy shares that he has spoken with Noor about her ideas and that Diego is involved. They agree to feed the park stray animals together after their meeting on Tuesday as a nice touch for the collaborative project. Caroline expresses her enthusiasm for the project and supports Andy's leadership. She suggests that everyone is welcome to join in, and they plan to meet at the museum on Tuesday.\n\nAndy also talks to Peter at the theater around 6:00 AM, where he discusses incorporating Diego's fitness expertise into their mural project plans during their taco meet-up at El Charro. They agree to bounce design ideas off each other that night before regrouping at Peter's place after dinner.",

We might have dinner together before the brainstorming session next week?\n\nNoor: That would be great, let's make it a double date with Peter and Mei at that new taco spot you mentioned. Also, I've got a dinner with Samantha on Tuesday to discuss more project details. Leo's robotics club is joining us too!\n\nCaroline: Wonderful! Looking forward to our double date this weekend and the improvisation session at the park today if you can make it?\n\nNoor: I might be busy tending to my strays behind the cafe tonight, but let's catch up more at the cafe this weekend for sure. See you around!",
