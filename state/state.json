Yes, we planned to practice our bird duet near the old oak tree tomorrow evening. We'd love for you to join us and maybe show off your latte art skills too!\n\nAndy: That sounds amazing! I've been thinking about incorporating a chamomile element for the stray cats as well. Can I bring that up during our discussion under the gazebo tomorrow?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely! And remember, Leo suggested bringing his improvised instruments too. We all look forward to seeing your ideas come together.\n\nAndy: Thanks, Caroline. I can't wait for this collaboration. Let's make sure to invite everyone else in the group as well.\n\nCaroline: Agreed! See you under the gazebo tomorrow then.

I've also invited Diego to join us today. We can share ideas and make this community event a success.\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect! I already reached out to Andy, Leo, and Mei for music. We should have quite an interesting creative session together.\n\nPeter: Indeed. And I think involving Samantha in our discussions about chamomile tea for the stray kitties would be a great idea too, if you agree?\n\nNoor: Absolutely!
