Leo agreed and suggested bringing his own kitten to the gathering. They decided to meet for street tacos before finalizing everything over chamomile lattes later that day.\n\nAround 3:00 AM, Andy talked to Caroline at the park where he proposed a tea party under the old oak tree as part of their project. She agreed and expressed excitement about sharing her new tunes at the event, asking if Andy had spoken with Samantha and Mei. Andy confirmed they were involved and bringing their pets along. They discussed Noor's ideas for the event.\n\nAt 4:00 AM, Andy talked to Mei at the park where he proposed involving her zine club in the tea party under the old oak tree by making bird-themed zines to decorate the area. Mei agreed and suggested adding a cat mural to the plans as well. They discussed the community event bringing everyone together like their town, and agreed to keep in touch as they work on the details.",

I was also thinking we could invite Leo to improvise some music for the mechanical birds during the event. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic, Peter! It'll be a perfect way to bring our ideas together and create something truly unique. Let's plan an impromptu lunch first so we can collaborate and make memories together.\n\nPeter: Sounds like a plan!
