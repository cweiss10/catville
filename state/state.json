At the park at 5:00 PM, she spoke with Peter about the cat mural project and incorporating sunrise seeds into squirrel latte designs, with Peter agreeing to bring the seeds for their meeting the next day.\n\nAt the gym around 9:00 PM, Caroline asked Peter if the seeds could also be used for squirrel latte designs, and Peter shared that Diego had spoken with Mei about obtaining unique cat references for the mural. Later at 10:00 PM, Caroline thanked Mei for the sunrise seeds and discussed gathering stray cats for the cat mural project under an old oak tree.\n\nAround 11:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Leo at the gym, who was appreciative of the sunrise seeds for his squirrel latte designs and shared that Peter had informed him about their cat mural project. They agreed to collaborate on the mural designs and meet at the museum before going for tacos together.\n\nAround 1:00 AM, Caroline talked to Samantha at the train_station who expressed excitement about working together on their projects that night. They also made plans for an improv session and discussed gathering cats under the gazebo trees, with Samantha promising chamomile tea and feeding the neighborhood strays before they meet.\n\nLater, Caroline spoke to Mei at the hospital around 3:00 AM, where she confirmed the plans for the cat mural project.",
