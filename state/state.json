Leo enthusiastically agreed and invited the members of Diego's robotics club to help with sound systems and noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nLater, around 1:00 PM, Leo spoke with Andy at the market and made plans to catch up over tea later in the day under an old oak tree. During their discussion, they further developed ideas for the cat mural project, including inviting Diego, rehearsing with his robotics club, and involving Noor and her kids for a practice session the following day before meeting at the park. Both Leo and Andy agreed to ensure Stray-13, the mural's cat, would be well taken care of during their collaborative session.",
