The meeting would take place at Main Street Tacos at 6 PM the following day.\n\nLater in the evening, Leo spoke with Mei at the market. They discussed potential involvement of Mei's yoga students and Mei's coffee meeting with Noor. Leo also suggested a surprise bird duet performance at the park after their meeting.
