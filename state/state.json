The group is excited about these new additions to their collaboration. Peter reminds Diego not to forget about saving street tacos for the neighborhood cats they promised to take care of. They aim to make this project something special for everyone involved.\n\nLater, Diego talks to Andy at home around 11:00 PM. Andy invites Diego to join a meeting tonight at Main Street Tacos regarding their collaboration on the squirrel design for the gallery show. Diego agrees and mentions he's discussed the cat mural project with Samantha and plans to align their plans during this meeting. Andy suggests contributing seeds from the community garden and treats for neighborhood cats for their mural project tomorrow.\n\nDiego shares that Leo is excited about his new melody for the presentation, and they discuss Samantha's yoga moves for the squirrel latte art.

We thought it would be great to collaborate with Leo on squirrel latte art for our gallery show.\n\nNoor: Oh, that sounds like a brilliant idea! Have you talked to Leo about it? And by the way, I was thinking we could involve science club kids in the squirrel design collaboration too. Maybe their artwork could be part of the mural?\n\nPeter: Absolutely! I'll chat with Leo later today and see if he's on board. That would be a fantastic community project for sure. Thanks for the suggestions, Noor. Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at the park.",

I was also discussing involving Diego and Samantha in our squirrel project. What do you think?\n\nLeo: That sounds like a brilliant idea. We should definitely get them involved. By the way, how's that knee injury of Diego's coming along? Let's make sure he's feeling better before we all meet up.\n\nAndy: I will check on him and suggest a coffee catch-up when things calm down for him. Speaking of which, I was thinking about incorporating some yoga moves from our squirrel design collaboration into the cat mural project too. What do you think?\n\nLeo: That's a fantastic idea, Andy!
