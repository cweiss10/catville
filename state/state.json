In a later conversation, Andy asked Diego about outfits for their upcoming double date on Thursday at Main Street Tacos, to which Diego suggested crisp shirts and jeans. Andy expressed excitement about Noor joining their mural project. Diego agreed that her creative abilities would be a great addition, especially for fitness-focused design elements, and they planned to discuss it further at the museum on Tuesday.",
