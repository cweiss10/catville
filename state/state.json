Later, Leo had conversations with Noor at a train station (6:00 AM) and Mei at school (10:00 AM). With Noor, they discussed their progress on the music-art collaboration for the coffee gallery and expressed excitement to bring their ideas together at the zine club this weekend.\n\nThey also talked about Noor's recent projects with Peter and expressed enthusiasm about their collaborations at the school and with Caroline's theater project. The conversation concluded with Leo admiring Noor's recent work and looking forward to more collaborative efforts.\n\nIn his conversation with Mei, they discussed her excitement about the upcoming zine club meeting, where Leo's stories would be a great fit. They also talked about Mei's ongoing collaborations with Andy and Peter on various projects, including an mural idea and a fitness-themed art piece, which they planned to discuss further next week.\n\nLeo spoke to Diego at the train station around 11:00 AM. Diego praised Leo's improv at the station earlier that day and discussed their collaboration on the theater project with Andy. They also agreed on incorporating herbs from Leo's garden into the mural for the community center event, as well as a hidden reading nook.\n\nLeo mentioned involving kids from the community center in the gallery show and talked about Samantha's rehab program for his knee injury, which they planned to incorporate into their yoga session. Diego suggested meeting up later that day for street tacos to further discuss details of their collaborative projects. Leo agreed, looking forward to a catch-up over delicious tacos and shared enthusiasm for their creative efforts.",
