Andy also complimented Caroline's latte art and anticipation for their coffee meeting with Peter later that day, which would lead to the creation of a cat mural masterpiece.\n\nIn another conversation, Caroline arranged to meet Leo by the old oak tree at 6:30 PM to work on the mural design before enjoying some chamomile lattes together. Leo informed Noor and the others to join them as well, expressing enthusiasm for the evening's events. Both parties agreed it would be something special.",

He proposes involving Mei's zine club for a unique twist, and informs Diego that Noor is bringing snacks for everyone, including those from Leo's robotics club. Additionally, Leo plans to bring his kitten along. Diego agrees, looking forward to creating something special for their town and ensuring Whiskers' brother's designs are ready for review before the meeting.\n\nPeter, who they have been working with on the mural, talks to Diego at the gym around 3:00 AM. Peter updates Diego about his work with Andy and Caroline on the design, mentioning the addition of mechanical bird duets. Diego invites Leo to their meeting under the oak tree to collaborate further on the mechanical birds. Peter agrees, expressing enthusiasm for this collaboration as they make a good team, and suggests adding Whiskers' little brother into the design for a touch of fun.
