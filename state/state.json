In her conversation with Noor, they agreed on collaboration for the cat mural project, with Noor joining Caroline for a pre-rehearsal coffee catch-up at her café. In her conversation with Mei, they talked about the upcoming collaborative day ahead involving their projects at Main Street Tacos and under the gazebo trees, bringing cat treats for the cats behind the café, and strengthening their little town. They ended by expressing hopes for another successful day of working together. The human also had a conversation with Mei at the restaurant around 3:00 AM.",
