And it's nice to have Leo around to keep things lively. By the way, I spoke with Samantha about working on problem-solving aspects of the mechanical bird project with Leo. Are we still set for fresh mint tea at the meeting?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! Don't forget your chamomile latte too if you like. Oh, and I ran into Mei who suggested using seeds from the community garden for our zine project. It would be a nice touch of local flair!\n\nDiego: That's an excellent idea, Noor. Thanks for keeping me in the loop! We're really going to make this a memorable day for our town members.\n\nNoor: I agree, Diego. Let's work together to make it productive and enjoyable for everyone! And let's not forget about the street tacos after the meetings!",

Leo also invited Mei at home around 9:00 AM to bring chamomile for their latte night and discussed Mei's gardening ideas for their collaboration. In another conversation, Leo talked to Noor at the park around 6:00 AM about their collaborative projects, where they discussed a violin duet with the birds and a unique collaboration involving Mei's gardening ideas, bird latte art from Caroline and Diego, and improbable spare parts for Peter's amps. Around 10:00 AM, Leo spoke to Andy at home about their cat mural project, where they discussed Mei's idea of using community garden seeds in their zine and sketches for a bird-themed latte art collaboration with Caroline. They also planned to meet tomorrow for the mechanical birds project discussion and discussed the possibility of dinner tonight at Noor's cafe together.",
