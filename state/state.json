How about we add fish tacos to our menu at the cat feeding tomorrow night?\n\nDiego: Sounds like a great idea, Noor. I've been talking to Andy about squirrel latte art with Peter, and we're meeting at the park early tomorrow to discuss details. How about a quadruple date after that?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! Looking forward to it. And don't forget to bring your A-game, Diego. I know Leo's been working on some amazing bird improvisations for our mural project.\n\nDiego: You can count on it. We want to impress everyone at Main Street Tacos with our collaboration. Thanks for all the planning and collaboration, Noor.
