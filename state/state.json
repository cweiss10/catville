They also agreed to bring noise-cancelling headphones to the meeting under the gazebo trees, where Diego had brought sunrise seeds as a thoughtful gesture. Their conversation demonstrated their ongoing collaboration and mutual excitement for their community projects.\n\nLater that night, Andy spoke to Mei at the library. They proposed a joint meeting to finalize their community projects, which included integrating robotics into their work. Mei agreed, suggesting they meet at Main Street Tacos at 2 PM the next day and bring seeds from her garden for the gazebo trees. Andy promised to also bring snacks for the stray cats. They ended their conversation by discussing the possibility of grabbing a \"squirrel latte\" afterwards. Their exchange demonstrated the expansion of their collaborative artistic community, now involving robotics and including more members.",
