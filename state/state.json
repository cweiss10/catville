And speaking of collaboration, have you heard about Samantha from the theater? Andy thinks she could be a great fit for our team too.\n\nDiego: Oh yeah? Let's definitely meet up this Thursday and discuss this with her ideas over coffee. I think an interactive mini lab station for the mural would be fantastic.\n\nNoor: Absolutely! It sounds like a perfect way to bring our projects together. And maybe we can invite Andy and Leo too, so everyone can collaborate effectively.\n\nDiego: Definitely! Let's also make sure to discuss Peter's idea about involving stray animals at the park in our project as well. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That's a wonderful idea! I'll make sure to bring it up during our brainstorming sessions this weekend at the community garden. Let's work together to create something truly special.",
