Meanwhile, Leo also visited Mei at her home, discussing details of their mural and mechanical birds project.\n\nThe next morning, Leo spoke with Andy at the museum, who saved him a spot under the old oak tree for their mechanical bird project. Around 9:00 AM, Noor had a conversation with Peter at the park regarding brainstorming on her cat mural and kinetic plant sculptures under the old oak tree that night.\n\nAt around 9:00 PM, Leo talked to Caroline at the library about their plans for the upcoming gathering under the old oak tree. They agreed to have street tacos, a violin duet, mint tea, seedlings for Caroline's garden, and chamomile lattes provided by Peter. Everyone looked forward to a night of great music, creative synergy, and extraordinary collaboration on various projects.",
