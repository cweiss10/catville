Leo surprises Samantha with a proposal for discussing her unique sunrise seeds idea over tea at a cafe around 2:00 PM while waiting for their respective dates under the gazebo trees.\n\nAround 7:00 PM, Andy suggests meeting under the old oak tree and Leo shares his plan to serenade Caroline with music involving sunrise seeds. Meanwhile, Samantha meets up with Leo at the gym around 11:00 PM for a quick break and a quiet duet before returning to their respective tasks.\n\nDuring the school hours of 1:00 AM, Peter expresses his excitement about the improv session under the gazebo trees and mentions that he has brought sunrise seeds for the mural project, appreciating Leo's efforts to create art and strengthen their community.",
