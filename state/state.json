Let's meet under the old oak tree tomorrow at 2 PM?\n\nNoor: That sounds great, Mei! I was just about to reach out to you. We can discuss it further over lunch at Main Street Tacos after our meeting. By the way, I talked to Diego and he has some updates on the project progress too.\n\nMei: Wonderful! I've also shared my ideas with Samantha, who suggested a bird duet for the event. We should collaborate more closely, don't you think?\n\nNoor: Absolutely, Mei! And I agree with you on bringing some chamomile tea for those stray kitties at our community event. Looking forward to it!",
