The conversation also includes a discussion on latte art, with both Mei and Diego suggesting it, indicating a shared creative spirit.\n\nAt around 11:00 PM, Mei talks to Diego at the park where he shares that stretching and street tacos have been his saving grace after an injury. He promises a surprise for their event collaboration at the gazebo. Mei suggests feeding stray cats together before their meeting on Sunday, to which Diego agrees and proposes incorporating cat interactions into their performance at Main Street Tacos. They plan to share ideas and make this an unforgettable night. Later, at around 1:00 AM, the conversation continues at a restaurant, with no additional details provided. The collaborative project for the zine club is progressing, with participants exchanging ideas and looking forward to memorable events.",
