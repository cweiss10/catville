I talked to Diego about it this morning, and he timed his run under the oak tree as well. He mentioned Noor will be joining us soon.

During a conversation with Andy at school, Andy suggests using sunrise seeds in their collaboration, and they discuss Noor's idea for this project, which seems perfect.\n\nLeo later talks to Caroline at a museum around 6:00 PM, who shares her excitement about the cat mural project and mentions Peter's idea of incorporating sunrise seeds into the project. Leo plans to further discuss this collaboration under the old oak tree that evening before running together as usual. They are also excited about another day of creativity and friendship, planning to maintain their cozy café vibe during their collaborative projects.",

(pauses) I've heard a lot about your open-source work and cat mural project.\n\nSamantha: Ah, yes, that would be me—the quiet programmer behind the cafe. It was kind of Mei to invite you over for our gathering under the old oak tree tomorrow. (smiles) And I'm glad she suggested sunrise seeds for the cats.\n\nLeo: It does sound like a wonderful idea! I can't wait to meet everyone and share my musical ideas. Speaking of which, Peter and Andy have been working on a new collaboration involving those sunrise seeds. We might discuss it during our meeting tonight. (winks)\n\nSamantha: That sounds exciting! I look forward to hearing more about it then.
