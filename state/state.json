The group also discusses a yoga session before working on the mural project.\n\nThe following morning, Leo talks to Andy about collaborating on the squirrel song mural project and agrees to a double date with Noor, Peter, and possibly Samantha over coffee at El Charro. They also plan to involve the robotics club in brainstorming sessions for the mural and make it interactive for kids during their performance in the park. Peter suggests incorporating logic puzzles into the design, which Leo agrees upon. The group decides to meet at El Charro this week to discuss further details over tacos.\n\nLater that day, Leo has a conversation with Andy at the park, where Andy shares his sketches for the mural and proposes inviting Noor, Peter, and Samantha for dinner that evening to discuss the logic puzzles in the design. Leo agrees and suggests involving the robotics club members as well. They plan a fun-filled day starting with a yoga session the following day before diving into the project. Leo is excited about the collaborative work ahead.",
