Let's work on them this weekend.\n\nNoor: Absolutely, Caroline! And don't forget about our quadruple date at El Charro before Tuesday. Can't wait to see your cat nook design and outfit ideas.\n\nCaroline: I'm really excited about that! And speaking of outfits, you should check out the new indie singer gig this Friday. You might even inspire some lyrics.\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic, Caroline! In fact, I think the students could benefit from a field trip to your cafe and theater sometime.\n\nCaroline: Sounds like a plan, Noor! Let's keep the collaborations flowing and make more memorable times together.",
