They also discuss a bird duet under the gazebo, with Peter planning to discuss it with Caroline. The group also considers Noor's latte art potential for their evening performance.\n\nThe conversation then turns to Andy and Diego's quadruple date preparations, involving Leo, Mei, and Diego in the music at the gazebo, anticipating a magical night that could inspire new projects around town.\n\nDuring a subsequent phone call with Samantha, Andy proposes working on a logic puzzle together during their next collaborative session under the gazebo trees.
