Andy suggests involving Mei's zine club in decorating under the old oak tree for the event, and Mei proposes creating bird-themed zines featuring her students' artwork. They agree to meet up later for chamomile lattes to discuss further details.\n\nAndy shares that they spoke with Diego about their project details and have exciting ideas brewing. Mei mentions running into Noor at the park, who suggested involving Noor's zine club friends as well. Andy proposes having more bird-themed zines from Mei's club under the old oak tree and suggests collaborating with Samantha on her new city sounds and Peter's garden seeds for a more immersive experience. They also discuss inviting Noor to perform her healing melody during their tea party at the old oak tree, bringing pets to the event, and considering Leo's violin improvisations as an additional feature. Looking forward to their meeting the next day, they express excitement about working together on this community event.",
