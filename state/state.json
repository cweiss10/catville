And don't forget to stretch before we dive in. We want to create a masterpiece for this project.\n\nNoor: Absolutely, Diego! I've got snacks and water for our team too. Let's make sure everyone is comfortable while we work.\n\nDiego: Perfect! Looking forward to it, Noor. See you there tomorrow morning at 3:00 AM sharp.\n\nNoor: Can't wait, Diego!

How are things at the library?\n\nMei: Ah, yes, that collaboration is proving fruitful indeed. I was just discussing some future projects with Andy late last night. By the way, did we decide on the theme for the squirrel mural yet?\n\nNoor: Not officially, but Leo and I were thinking about making it educational while still being creative, like focusing on their diet or behaviors. How about a small ritual to celebrate its completion?\n\nMei: That sounds delightful! Perhaps we could plant a community garden squirrel-friendly tree to mark the occasion.",

Caroline shares her excitement about involving the robotics club in the project, which Leo agrees is a great idea. They plan to meet at El Charro for a brainstorming session before their double date and discuss tasting some tacos together. Later, Leo offers to busk a tune for Caroline before they head to the caf√©.\n\nAt 9:00 PM, Leo talks to Mei at the cafe where she saved them a spot by the window. Leo sets up his instruments and talks about potentially growing something magical in their garden. Mei asks about Leo's progress on the squirrel tune for the musical and mural project, to which Leo replies that he has only created a sketch but is excited to play it at El Charro.\n\nAround 12:00 AM, Leo talks to Noor at the museum, likely discussing their shared projects or plans.",
