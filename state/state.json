They decide to finalize the details tomorrow at the community garden, and consider adding a live kitten for creative inspiration.\n\nAt around 4:00 AM, Leo talks to Andy at the town hall where Andy appreciates Leo's improvisational music with the birds from their morning performance at the park. They discuss the possibility of Andy incorporating sound into his artwork and the need for Leo's violin skills. Andy agrees to bring tea in a thermos to the potluck, and they look forward to their creative evening under the stars. Leo encourages Andy about the prospect of a solo gallery show.\n\nAround 7:00 AM, Diego contacts Leo at the gym, asking about plans for tonight. Leo invites him to join them at the community garden where they are finalizing their mechanical bird design for the cat mural project. Diego accepts and suggests turning it into a creative gathering under the oak tree. He also proposes swapping ideas over some street tacos afterwards, just like old times.",
