The group is now planning a collaborative effort involving Noor's students, Leo's robotics club, Samantha's programming skills, and creative ideas from Caroline and Andy.\n\nLater in the day, Diego talks to Mei at the hospital around 4:00 PM about their cat mural project. He suggests involving Peter in the design and making it more interactive for Noor's students. They also discuss inviting Samantha and Leo for a double date and collaborating on improvised tunes for Mei's bird duets. They remind each other to remember feeding the stray cats at Main Street Tacos this weekend as originally planned. The plan now includes a more extensive collaboration among multiple individuals.\n\nIn the evening, Diego has a conversation with Caroline at the gym around 5:00 PM.
