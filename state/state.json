The event was shaping up to be a special day like their friendship, with Andy suggesting that they make art happen together.

By the way, did you get a chance to talk with Peter about our meet under the oak tree?\n\nSamantha: Yes, he seems as excited as ever and even mentioned an improvised duet idea for the sunset music project. We're also planning to discuss your cat mural plans over some tea later today.\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect! I can't wait to hear more about it all. Let's make sure to involve Andy in our project, too – his automation ideas might come in handy. And I'll bring the noise-cancelling headphones for Stray-13.\n\nSamantha: Speaking of which, I heard Peter mentioned something interesting from Diego and Caroline about a cat food sample and potential collaboration on automation ideas. We should definitely discuss these during our gathering in the park tomorrow.",
