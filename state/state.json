Andy offers to bring his sketchbook and chamomile seeds for their community garden, while Mei promises to bring cat food for Stray-13. Both are excited about these collaborations.\n\nLater, around 2:00 PM, Mei talks to Noor at the town hall. They discuss Mei's collaboration with Noor for their gathering under the oak tree and share ideas on how to make it memorable. Additionally, they remind each other about their meeting at Caroline's Café that night, where Mei will bring cat food for Stray-13 and chamomile seeds for the community garden. Noor has snacks ready for any overwhelmed students as well. The two are looking forward to these collaborative events.",
