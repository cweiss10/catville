Diego expressed his excitement about collaborating with gym routine ideas.\n\nAt 12 PM, Andy talked to Mei at the town hall about the upcoming collaboration meeting for the cat mural project. They shared ideas and looked forward to their meeting at Main Street Tacos. Andy mentioned taking turns tending to the stray cats after the meeting with Diego, which Noor supported as an opportunity for team bonding.\n\nAt 1 PM, Andy spoke to Noor at the park about making it a regular activity to spend time with and show extra love to the strays in their local town, which Noor thought was a great idea. They agreed on this new activity being beneficial both for the cats and their team bonding.\n\nAt 4 PM, Andy talked to Samantha at the museum about the cat mural project. They were excited to share ideas and remembered to bring cat treats for the feline friends under the gazebo. Andy also invited Samantha to join him and Peter on a double date that night with Diego and Noor.\n\nAt 9 PM, Andy spoke to Peter at the museum about their collaboration using sunrise seeds for the community project. They were looking forward to the double date and confirmed the plans for the cat mural project, including Samantha's attendance the next day at the gazebo.",
