I'm sure he'll love it and learn a lot from your workshops. Maybe he'll even inspire some of the kids with his own talents in theater!\n\nAndy: Exactly my thoughts!

It might attract more people that way.\n\nMei: That's a wonderful idea! Let me see if we can arrange that for next month. I'm all for making our town stronger with small rituals like yours and mine. Shall we grab dinner together at the taqueria down the block? Your street tacos are always a treat.\n\nDiego: Sounds perfect. I'll meet you there after my run, and we can catch up over some delicious food. See you soon!",

Speaking of which, have you tried that new Mexican place down the street? The food's supposed to be fantastic.\nDiego: Nah, haven't gotten around to it yet. But I've heard great things! Maybe we can catch up there some time and you can give me the lowdown? You always seem to know the best spots.\n\nPeter: Absolutely, Diego! Let's definitely make that happen soon. It'd be nice to catch up outside of the park or the gym. Plus, who knows â€“ maybe we can even collaborate on something fitness-related with your expertise and my business acumen.\nDiego: Sounds like a plan, Peter. I'm always down for street tacos and brainstorming new ideas. Just let me know when and where!",
