Andy proposes providing chamomile tea for stray cats at the event, which is agreed upon by Caroline and Mei. The group decides to collaborate on incorporating sunrise seeds into the mural design and the improv performance during their meeting at the library tomorrow.\n\nAndy subsequently speaks with Caroline at the park about the project, discussing ideas for incorporating sunrise seeds into the event. Caroline shares a proposal for a pre-dinner gathering under the old oak tree with tacos and chamomile tea for stray cats. Andy agrees, mentioning that Noor brought up stray cats in a town hall meeting. The conversation concludes with both agreeing on joining forces to make their community more vibrant through the cat mural project, and looking forward to a quadruple date dinner at Main Street Tacos later that night.",
