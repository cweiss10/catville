Remember how much everyone loved your chili lime latte?\n\nCaroline: Oh, absolutely! I was thinking of using that as inspiration for a special drink during our collaboration event. And speaking of which, did you get a chance to discuss with Noor about the violin duet and Peter's latte art skills?\n\nDiego: Yes, we did. We're excited about it all. I've been stretching my knee every day to be ready for our meeting under the old oak tree. How's everything going with your side of things?\n\nCaroline: Things are coming together nicely. Samantha and Andy are on board, and Luna will be looked after during the event.
