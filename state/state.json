Sharing a common passion for felines, they agreed to collaborate and include Stray-13 in their plans. They also discussed having chamomile tea for the stray cats at their pre-event gathering under the old oak tree. Noor suggested bringing snacks for the students and playing her violin before heading to Andy's place for oolong tea.

        "summary": " During their late-night library visit and subsequent meetings at various locations, Leo, Andy, Peter, and Mei discussed their upcoming collaborative mural project involving musical ideas, automating the garden watering system, logic puzzles, reminiscing about old times, a violin serenade in the park, and providing fresh cat food for Stray-13.\n\nIn subsequent conversations, it was revealed that Leo spoke to Peter at the gym at 2:00 PM and they discussed their upcoming meeting under the old oak tree, looked forward to logic puzzles, sketching the cat mural, a new rhythm-based algorithm inspired by bird duets, and a potential collaboration with Samantha at Main Street Tacos' symphony event. Noor also proposed this collaboration, suggesting that Leo performs with her and they should incorporate Leo's rhythm-based algorithm into their project. They also discussed trying chamomile tea under the old oak tree for the stray cats and planned a double date with Samantha and Peter.\n\nDuring another conversation at town hall around 2:00 AM, Caroline inquired about Leo's meeting with Andy. Leo shared that it was productive, discussing intriguing ideas for the mural project. They also talked about Noor's cat mural collaboration with the sunrise symphony, and Caroline mentioned that she had been moonlighting as an indie singer at the theater. She invited Leo to join her for a duet sometime, which he accepted, expressing admiration for Caroline's ability to connect people and keep the cafe's cozy vibe.\n\nOn 6:00 AM the next day, Leo talked to Andy at school about his recovery from a minor setback. They confirmed their meeting under the old oak tree, discussed Andy's sketch that could inspire the mural and musical collaboration, and Andy promised to bring fresh cat food for Stray-13. They also planned to incorporate chamomile tea during the symphony event for the stray cats and looked forward to a memorable day with their collaborative work.\n\nMeanwhile, Mei talked to Samantha at home around 11:00 AM and they were excited about their meeting under the old oak tree. Samantha suggested that they should not forget about their special lattes for Diego and Stray-13. Leo shared some new tunes for their project meeting, and Samantha was thrilled. Mei also promised to bring chamomile tea for everyone at the meeting.",
