They also made plans for mint tea and garden chat at Caroline's cafe the next day with Samantha.\n\nSamantha expressed excitement about the street taco night collaboration and helped with the robotics club plans, while discussing a choir collaboration with Andy and Noor. Caroline and Noor discussed their mechanical bird project at the market, planning to showcase it at the open mic night, with the idea of including Diego's help with mechanics. At 11:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Leo about the seedlings for the mechanical bird project, praising his gardening skills, and they made plans for a duet under the old oak tree, followed by street tacos afterwards. Both Peter and Andy are still involved in discussions regarding the community garden project.",
