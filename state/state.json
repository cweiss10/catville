Later in the day, at approximately 7 PM, Leo receives a message from Noor suggesting they involve the robotics club in their project, making it interactive for children during their park performance. They plan a brainstorming session over tacos at El Charro this week. In addition to this, Peter proposes a collaborative meeting tonight at El Charro to discuss the cat nook project and make progress on Leo's squirrel song for the musical. Leo agrees, expressing excitement about bouncing ideas off each other and creating something remarkable together. Peter also inquires about the status of the squirrel song, to which Leo replies that it's coming along nicely and looks forward to collaborating with Noor on it.",

I'd love to hear more about it during our park duet tomorrow. How about we also invite Diego and Caroline tonight for some tacos at El Charro? I think they'd be excited to contribute.\n\nLeo: Agreed.
