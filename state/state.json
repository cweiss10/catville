Peter mentions they are both meeting under an old oak tree tomorrow. Diego learns about potential collaborations between them, including a cat mural project by Leo and a contribution from Mei for stray cats.

        "summary": " During their discussions throughout the day, Leo, Samantha, and others continued planning their cat mural project, garden collaboration, and musical improvisations. They made arrangements to collaborate on automating the garden watering system, meet under the old oak tree that evening, walk through the park while exchanging seeds for the garden, fresh cat food for pets, and enjoy oolong tea.\n\nIn a new development, Samantha proposed a collaboration on the garden automation project, which Leo enthusiastically accepted. She also offered to bring her violin for a serenade during their walk through the park, fresh cat food, and noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nLater in the day, Leo spoke with Peter at a restaurant and Caroline at the park about their collaborative projects. Peter suggested discussing the garden watering system during their meeting under the old oak tree that evening. Both parties agreed to bring relevant ideas, including logic puzzles from Peter and violin music from Samantha.\n\nAt sunset, Peter joined Leo and Caroline for their brainstorming session about the garden watering system and logic puzzle integration in their upcoming projects. They were all excited about the collaborative evening ahead. In a later development, Peter met with Leo at the town hall around 11:00 PM, complimenting his violin performance from the previous night. Peter shared that he had some logic puzzles to contribute to their meeting under the old oak tree the next day and expressed excitement about the upcoming double date with Stray-13 and Mei joining them.",

Have you finalized your musical ideas for the mural project?\n\nLeo: Yes, I've been working on a rhythm-based algorithm based on my bird duets. How about you? Did Mei bring any tea for our symphony discussions?\n\nAndy: Not yet, but she promised to bring some along later tonight. Have you spoken with Peter about automating the watering system like we planned?\n\nLeo: Yes, he's on board. We're also discussing the possibility of Samantha adding her logic puzzles into our symphony. Exciting times!\n\nAndy: Agreed! I can't wait to see this collaboration come together. Let's make sure we have a good cup of tea for tonight, shall we?\n\nLeo: Sounds perfect! See you under the old oak tree tomorrow then, Andy.",
