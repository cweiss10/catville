Diego also mentioned the need to ensure Leo has enough street tacos for the cats during their meeting under the old oak tree at 3 PM.\n\nIn another conversation at around 4 AM, Mei informed Caroline that Samantha will bring sunrise seeds and incorporate constellations into the mural. Noor offered to prepare tacos tonight and invite Samantha, while Diego will bring chamomile tea for Leo's knee during their meeting tomorrow.\n\nIn a conversation at around 8:00 AM, Caroline spoke with Mei at the gym about the cat mural progress and plans to meet under the old oak tree. They discussed involving Diego in the discussion, Leo's innovative ideas, the tacos dinner tonight, and collaborating more with their zine club.\n\nIn a conversation at around 10:00 AM, Andy asked Caroline if he could invite Leo to their cat mural meeting today. Caroline agreed, as Leo's violin skills would be a great addition to the project, and discussed Samantha's ideas for stray cat tea with him. Andy expressed excitement about the project and thanked Caroline for keeping him in the loop. They planned to meet at 6 PM.",

By the way, have you heard about Leo's idea of incorporating his amp into the mural?\n\nSamantha: Yes, he mentioned it when we talked at school. It could be an interesting addition, especially if we can find a way to make it blend seamlessly with the rest of the design. Maybe we can rehearse under the old oak tree once it's integrated?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! I think the bird duets under that tree would provide the perfect ambiance for our collaboration. Let's invite Leo, Diego, and perhaps even Peter and his pet for a double date there soon. What do you think?\n\nSamantha: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Noor. Let's make it happen. And maybe we could even serve chamomile tea for the stray cats during our meeting under that oak tree as a tradition, as Leo suggested.",
