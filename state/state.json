Diego suggested discussing stretches for their bird duet performance, reminded Samantha to bring her laptop and headphones, and praised her efforts in feeding stray cats behind the cafe as one small ritual that makes their town special.\n\nOn a separate note, during an early morning hospital visit, Samantha showed Diego her ideas for the interactive tree project and they agreed to discuss them over coffee at Main Street Tacos.
