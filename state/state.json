Noor also shared Diego's eagerness to join them under the gazebo. Regarding the squirrel latte contest, Noor suggested incorporating hazelnut cinnamon into the squirrel lattes for their contest. They confirmed plans for a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos and Leo was reminded about his promise to bring his violin during their creative sessions under the gazebo trees.\n\nLeo spoke to Andy at a cafe around 8:00 PM where Andy proposed some fun activities for their cat mural project under the gazebo. Leo suggested having a squirrel latte contest as part of their friendly competition and they agreed to make it a memorable quadruple date. They concluded by arranging to meet at Main Street Tacos the following day.\n\nLater, Leo talked to Caroline at the park around 9:00 PM where she reminded him about their duet under the gazebo trees. Caroline was excited for the squirrel latte contest too and suggested bringing some food for the stray cats as they did in the past. They confirmed the quadruple date at Main Street Tacos, and Leo assured her that he would bring his violin for their creative sessions under the gazebo trees.",
