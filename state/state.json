Planning a taco dinner was discussed for that night with Caroline's presence and Leo's innovative ideas and amp.\n\nLater, Mei thanked Diego for his cat treats and chamomile tea at the theater. They discussed incorporating sunrise seeds and constellations into the mural design while ensuring there'd be enough chamomile for stray cats during their meeting under the old oak tree the following day. Noor suggested inviting Caroline to join them, which Mei agreed to as they aimed to bring their families together for this collaborative project.\n\nAt 6:00 PM, Samantha from the gym shared that Peter mentioned their upcoming meeting under the old oak tree with her. Mei inquired about progress on the logic puzzles and amp issues related to the mural, to which Samantha responded positively, mentioning they're close to an exciting solution. They discussed Andy potentially helping Leo fix his amp, and maybe it could be incorporated into their design. Mei emphasized the importance of ensuring everything comes together at their meeting tomorrow.",
