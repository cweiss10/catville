Noor suggested her students could help with Leo's mechanical birds too, and proposed to involve them in Andy's event under the old oak tree. Andy then asked if Noor would bring her kitten as the event mascot, which she agreed to, while also mentioning the need for a safe spot during the seed planting ritual at Mei's garden.\n\nAround 3:00 PM, Andy spoke with Caroline at school who was excited about their community event under the old oak tree. Diego from the hospital, who was bringing Minerva for the cat mural, was also on board, thanks to Andy's invite. They finalized plans to meet that evening at the cafe to discuss details and agreed for Caroline to bring special drinks as a thank you gesture for Andy's organizing efforts.",

It's been a while since we talked outside of work. Yes, I'm still nursing it, but I'm excited to hear what you have in store. What's the plan?\n\nCaroline: We're collaborating with Leo on some musical performances and Samantha for city sounds incorporated into our mural. Plus, Peter suggested bringing his mechanical bird project too!\n\nDiego: That sounds amazing, Caroline! I can't wait to see Minerva roaming around the cat mural during the event. And speaking of that, have you talked to Mei about adding street tacos and chamomile lattes?\n\nCaroline: Yes, we've got it all planned! We should catch up at the cafe later today to finalize everything before our meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow. Are you free for a quick coffee run this afternoon?\n\nDiego: I'd love that. Let's make it 3 PM so I can take Minerva out for some fresh air too!",
