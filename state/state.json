At a train station around 1:00 PM, Andy proposed involving Noor's healing melody in the mural garden project. Noor suggested her students could help with Leo's mechanical birds too, and proposed to involve them in Andy's event under the old oak tree.\n\nAround 3:00 PM, Andy spoke with Caroline at school who was excited about their community event under the old oak tree. Diego from the hospital, who was bringing Minerva for the cat mural, was also on board, thanks to Andy's invite. They finalized plans to meet that evening at the cafe to discuss details and agreed for Caroline to bring special drinks as a thank you gesture for Andy's organizing efforts.\n\nLater in the day, around 4:00 PM, Andy talked to Peter at school. Peter mentioned he was discussing bird-themed art for the old oak tree with Mei. They decided to coordinate their projects and agreed to have a brainstorming session over tacos soon. Peter also thanked Andy for introducing him to Caroline, praising her latte art.",

What's the plan?\n\nCaroline: We're collaborating with Leo on some musical performances and Samantha for city sounds incorporated into our mural. Plus, Peter suggested bringing his mechanical bird project too!\n\nDiego: That sounds amazing, Caroline! I can't wait to see Minerva roaming around the cat mural during the event. And speaking of that, have you talked to Mei about adding street tacos and chamomile lattes?\n\nCaroline: Yes, we've got it all planned! We should catch up at the cafe later today to finalize everything before our meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow. Are you free for a quick coffee run this afternoon?\n\nDiego: I'd love that.
