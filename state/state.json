        "summary": " In their latest exchange of conversations, Mei discusses the collaboration between Noor's robotics club and the cat mural project at around 11:00 PM under an old oak tree. She talks about Leo's ideas for automating the watering system and a surprise for Diego from her and Andy. They agree to maintain quiet moments during their evening meetings, such as Leo's shared symphony.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation with Peter at home around 2:00 AM, they discuss incorporating Mei's sunrise seeds initiative into the cat mural project. Peter suggests that Leo's sketches and ideas from the zine club could be used to incorporate music during the event. They also plan a double date at Main Street Tacos, as suggested by Noor, and decide to meet early the next day for Peter's sunrise sketch session.\n\nMei mentions that she met with Diego earlier in the day to discuss preparations for their meeting and plans a group run before dinner. They also consider involving Diego and Caroline to help with the violin repair for the music project. Peter agrees, noting that it's not just about networking but finding real connections like this one. Both agree that they are turning their projects into something special.",
