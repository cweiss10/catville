Mei suggested a cat-themed concert where Diego's squirrel tunes might fit in. Both were excited about the unique art and science collaboration unfolding in their town.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Diego visited Caroline at her restaurant around 9:00 AM.

Caroline expressed excitement for collaborating on a park project and agreed to catch up while preparing the coffee. Peter was planned to discuss collaborating with Mei and Samantha later in the week, including their cat-themed concert idea.
