Later at the gym around 11:00 AM, Caroline talked to Peter who suggested incorporating sunrise seeds into the squirrel latte designs as she had proposed. Peter also shared that he and Mei were discussing ways to care for stray cats in the community, suggesting they gather them under the old oak tree before dinner that night.\n\nAt the museum around 12:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Leo about the gazebo serenade and the cat mural project. They discussed incorporating sunrise seeds into the squirrel latte designs and how Samantha's sketches would help bring it all together. Both agreed on collaborating with her that night to ensure the stray cats also received a memorable experience in their community.",
