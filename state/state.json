Diego suggested they incorporate their passions into the get-together and serve street tacos as well.\n\nAndy also mentioned speaking with Mei earlier in the day about chamomile lattes at the afternoon meeting at the community garden, which she seemed enthusiastic about.

I was hoping you could join us as well. We can finalize everything for our taco night.\n\nNoor: I'd love that! And speaking of collaborations, I thought your robotics club might help with some flower decorations for our event. Let's talk about it more at the pre-event meeting over tacos tonight, as Caroline suggested?\n\nPeter: Perfect timing, Noor. Let's catch up on all the details then.
