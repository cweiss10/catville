They agree to meet at Main Street Tacos after Diego's yoga session to further discuss and capture the ambiance.\n\nAdditionally, Peter mentions inviting Leo to join them with his hospital gig, and they consider a potential yoga session before the performance as suggested by Andy. Samantha shares that Noor suggests incorporating a cat feeding station at El Charro as part of their project idea, which Diego finds brilliant. They agree to discuss this and other details in their meeting at Main Street Tacos on Thursday evening. Furthermore, Diego proposes using his noise-cancelling headphones during the mural session, which Samantha welcomes due to her preference for routines and logic puzzles.",

I actually bumped into Diego at the market this morning and he suggested we all meet here today. I brought my noise-cancelling headphones, remember? For our park sessions.\n\nSamantha: Oh yes, thank you! And speaking of which, I've been working on that duet with Mei for the performance. We can't wait to see what Leo brings to it with his squirrel song.\n\nNoor: Absolutely! It's going to be a wonderful collaboration. And Caroline mentioned setting up a cat feeding station at El Charro as well, so let's make sure we continue taking care of the neighborhood strays too.\n\nSamantha: I'll make sure to feed them tonight behind your café. Let's grab some coffee and get started on our mural plans.",
