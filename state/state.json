Are you free on Tuesday? How about a coffee meeting at the museum?\n\nSamantha: That sounds perfect, Caroline. Let's discuss our collaboration ideas then. And I also have an animal art project idea I'd like to run by you.\n\nCaroline: Of course! You know I'm here for that. Let's make sure we feed those park stray animals together after our meeting.
