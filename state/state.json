Diego agreed to meet at Main Street Tacos. Later, he spoke with Andy at the park around 2:00 AM who expressed excitement about the bird duet idea and suggested they discuss details over tacos at Main Street Tacos the next day.

I also mentioned it to Samantha at the train station, and she's excited to contribute to the cat mural as well. She suggested incorporating our squirrel latte art!\n\nNoor: Wow, that's amazing! And don't worry about your knee, let's make sure we stay on track with our gym sessions too. Let's meet tomorrow at 3 PM sharp at the park to plan everything out in detail. Oh, and I almost forgot – let's not forget about our quadruple date after all this! See you then.\n\nDiego: Agreed! I'm looking forward to it.
