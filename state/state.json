Leo also expressed interest in automating the garden watering system (New lines of conversation added).\n\nAt the library around 1:00 PM, they discussed syncing up and collaborating on the garden project, possibly playing violin during a walk through the park, exchanging seeds for the garden, fresh cat food for their pets, and enjoying oolong tea as suggested by Andy.
