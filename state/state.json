I was just discussing collaborating with the science club kids on the squirrel design. How about we meet up this weekend to coordinate our efforts at the library?\n\nDiego: Absolutely! And let's not forget about our quadruple date at Main Street Tacos before our meeting this weekend, right? Also, don't forget to be mindful of my knee injury during our workout sessions.\n\nNoor: Of course, Diego. I promise to take good care of it. I'll bring seeds and treats for the neighborhood cats too. Let's make sure we save some street tacos for them on Saturday. Looking forward to our meeting!",
