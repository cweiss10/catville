After Andy suggests using sunrise seeds in the mural design, they agree it complements Mei's squirrel latte design, improv music by Leo, and has significance for their town's art scene due to Caroline's conversation with Noor about stray cats and sunrise seeds.\n\nAndy proposes an improv singing session at the gazebo after dinner that evening and a community garden event. Mei suggests meeting at the library to finalize plans and discuss ideas from her zine club. During a conversation with Mei at the cafe, Andy mentions incorporating sunrise seeds into their singing date under the gazebo. Mei proposes a pre-dinner gathering under the old oak tree with tacos for everyone and chamomile tea for stray cats, inspired by an idea from Peter.\n\nIn a conversation with Peter at 6 PM, Andy thanks him for bringing Samantha on board for the project. Peter expresses his enthusiasm and suggests grabbing tacos beforehand, just like old times. He also promises to bring chamomile tea as per their usual tradition under the old oak tree that evening.",

Caroline suggested some new stretches that I might need to test out on that old oak tree we discussed for the symphony performance. What about you? Any exciting updates from the robotics club?\n\nNoor: Oh, yes! We're experimenting with sunrise seeds in our next project – it could add an interesting rhythm element to our symphony under the gazebo. And speaking of rhythms, I'm looking forward to Peter's improv music there too.\n\nDiego: Sounds amazing! I can't wait for that.
