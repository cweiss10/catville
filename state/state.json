Andy updated Diego on his discussion with Peter regarding mural design ideas. Diego also shared a rhythm-based algorithm idea he discussed with Noor and suggested working on it together over coffee.\n\nLater in the evening around 9:00 PM, Andy talked to Caroline at the theater. They discussed incorporating Stray-13 into the event and potential cat food options. Caroline mentioned that Noor might join their meeting under the old oak tree. Andy also shared his conversation with Peter about their cat mural project, which seemed exciting for him. Both expressed excitement about the upcoming community art projects bringing everyone closer together.\n\nThe next morning at 9:00 AM, Andy talked to Mei at a cafe. He was excited about incorporating his sunrise sketches into their symphony collaboration and they discussed potential locations for their tea time event, agreeing on meeting under the old oak tree.

Sharing excitement about these projects, they express admiration for each other and feel like they have found a home together.\n\nLater in the day, Leo talks to Peter around 9:00 AM about street tacos for their run the following day. They discuss the mural rhythm algorithm, stray cat food, improv duet ideas from Noor for the park scene in the mural, and involve Caroline's idea of using her spot in the cat mural for their gathering. Peter suggests inviting Noor to play the violin at the event, making cat food samples for Stray-13, involving Mei in their community project due to her unique talent for rhythm-based designs, and collaborating with her on the algorithm for the rhythm-based elements of their mural.\n\nLeo suggests meeting at Main Street Tacos after breakfast the next day to discuss everything in more detail, including an automated watering system and involving Samantha in their work. Mei promises a violin serenade under the old oak tree, and they agree to make the town's creative spirit shine brighter than ever by making the events unforgettable for everyone involved. They plan to meet again at 11:00 AM the next day, with Peter looking forward to their theater duet.",
