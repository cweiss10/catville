The group further discusses collaborating with Noor who will provide homemade chamomile tea for stray cats to join them during their project, and considers adding logic puzzles to make their cat mural stand out.\n\nExcited about the collaboration, Andy looks forward to seeing what they create together and suggests grabbing coffee or tacos after the double date this weekend. At 12:00 AM, Andy talks to Peter again, discussing a sunrise run at the old oak tree as a great start to their day, and agrees that adding logic puzzles could make their cat mural stand out. They also discuss collaborating with Noor and inviting Mei to join them.\n\nAt 1:00 AM, Andy talks to Mei at a restaurant about the mural project, and they agree to coordinate their meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow. Mei mentions she was planning to meet with Diego there later today to discuss mural ideas, and suggests making it a joint session. They further discuss Caroline's latte art skills at their event and agree that this project feels like more than just a project – it's their way of making a difference in this town. Mei expresses excitement about working with Andy on the project.",

And I can't forget to bring some extra tea for everyone. By the way, have you heard about Leo collaborating with Andy on fixing Peter's violin?\n\nCaroline: Oh, I know! They plan to rehearse under the old oak tree tomorrow and then gather at the theater once finished. Mei might help with constellation ideas for the bird duet, and there's a meeting about it by the cozy corner at 10 AM. It seems everyone is excited!\n\nSamantha: That sounds fantastic. I heard that Noor's robotics club will be joining the zine club too as part of our mural project team effort. I can't wait to see this community collaboration come together!\n\nCaroline: Agreed, Samantha. It's going to be another memorable project like the garden one, don't you think? Let's make it happen!",

Peter secured some chamomile tea for Diego's cats, and they plan to rehearse under the old oak tree tomorrow.\n\nNoor: Hi Caroline! Yes, I talked to Mei last night, we're all excited! We're even having a double date at Main Street Tacos before meeting there. And we thought it'd be nice to surprise Stray-13 with some sunrise seeds as a thank you for his help.\n\nCaroline: That sounds amazing! It's going to be such a special day, bringing us all closer together. And I'm really looking forward to collaborating with Leo on the bird duets and fixing your old violin.\n\nNoor: Absolutely! Your ability to connect people so gently is truly inspiring, Caroline. Can't wait for our theater rehearsal under the oak tree. Let's make some beautiful music!",
