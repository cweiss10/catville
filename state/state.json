We should involve Caroline and Leo for a collaborative effort. Let's meet under the old oak tree tomorrow to finalize our plans.\n\nAndy: Sounds great! I was planning on inviting Diego anyway. I also talked to Samantha about it, and she's excited to join in too. How about we bring chamomile tea for stray cats as well?\n\nMei: That's thoughtful, Andy. Let's make sure to discuss that with everyone during our meeting. By the way, I spoke with Peter about your squirrel latte design for the singing session at the local cafe. He can't wait to see it!\n\nAndy: Thanks Mei, I really appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone like you in my corner. Let's keep the momentum going!\n\nMei: Agreed, Andy.

Let's catch up after the robotics club meeting at your place under the old oak tree, around 4 PM?\n\nCaroline: Perfect! It'll give us time to strategize with Leo and Samantha before our meeting with Diego.

Caroline, who was captivated by her performance under the spotlight at the theater the previous night, suggests working on a duet with Leo involving violin and vocals.
