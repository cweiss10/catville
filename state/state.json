They plan to meet at Main Street Tacos on Thursday. Later, Andy talks to Diego at the library who is sketching the sunrise as usual. Diego learns about Andy and Peter's cat-themed concert project with Leo's squirrel tunes. He suggests Andy meet Caroline and Samantha who are working on a mural project for Main Street Tacos, potentially offering opportunities for collaboration between their projects.\n\nAt the train station around 6:00 AM, Andy talks to Noor about their plans for the mural idea with the cat feeding station. Andy suggests that Leo's squirrel tunes could really bring it alive. Noor agrees and they finalize plans to discuss further over tacos at Main Street Tacos the next day. They express excitement about collaborating again, as their creative synergy always produces something magical.\n\nLater in the day, Andy talks to Samantha at a cafe. Andy informs Samantha that he found Diego's headphones at the museum and plans to use them for their mural session tomorrow. They also discuss a quadruple date, although it hasn't been officially confirmed yet. Samantha mentions arranging dinner with Caroline as well. She asks Andy if they have talked to Diego about collaborating on the cat project, to which Andy replies that he is excited for Diego's involvement once he recovers. Samantha promises to propose his involvement when they meet tomorrow, and they plan to discuss details then.",
