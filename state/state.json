Later that day, around 11:00 PM, Caroline talked to Mei at school about her practice for designing the bird-shaped latte art and discussed seeds for the community garden. Mei invited Caroline to join her later, and they further discussed the mechanical birds' collaboration with Leo and their excitement about integrating them into the mural.

I've already started labeling potential parts and components for our project, just as you would with your open-source libraries. We make quite the team, don't we?\n\nSamantha: Indeed we do, Mei. And speaking of teams, have you heard about Peter's meeting with Leo regarding the project? Maybe they can bring some unique insights to our brainstorming session.\n\nMei: That sounds promising!
