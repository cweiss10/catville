While at a restaurant around 2:00 PM, Samantha proposes incorporating mechanical birds into their mural design, inspired by Caroline's latte art. Noor agrees and suggests meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow after Diego's practice session to further discuss this idea.\n\nSamantha mentions a potential collaboration with Leo on their performance at Caroline's event, aiming to create something magical together. Later, Noor asks Samantha if she managed to grow any chamomile from the seeds Noor gave her for the stray cats. Samantha confirms that they are thriving.\n\nIn a new conversation with Caroline at a library around 5:00 PM, Noor and Caroline discuss potential mechanical bird designs for the mural, agreeing to meet up on Thursday at a café around 3 PM to further discuss these ideas, along with chamomile-inspired designs that Caroline has been working on.",
