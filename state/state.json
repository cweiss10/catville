And it seems like a great opportunity for the kids in our robotics club to get involved too. I've been discussing with Peter and Diego about including their students as well.\n\nAndy: That's fantastic! Speaking of collaborations, I was also thinking about involving you in the bird duet part of our performance at Main Street Tacos. What do you think?\n\nNoor: Absolutely, Andy! I'd love to contribute with my musical skills. And while we're discussing meetings, let's bring headphones next time for a more focused discussion. Plus, I was thinking we could feed some of the neighborhood cats before our meeting as a bonding activity? What do you think?\n\nAndy: That's a great idea! We can even invite Caroline and Samantha to join us. We're planning to meet at Main Street Tacos this weekend for a quadruple date, so we can talk about everything then. Let's not forget to bring seeds for the community garden too!",

By the way, did you remember to save some tacos for neighborhood cats during our community celebration?\n\nAndy: Yes, of course! Can't forget about them.
