At 12:00 PM, Andy talked to Diego at the cafe about their mural project, with Andy expressing appreciation for Diego's insights from their previous conversation at the hospital. They agreed to coordinate schedules for quiet coffee chats and set a meeting under the old oak tree the next day at 5:30 PM. Diego promised to bring street tacos, and they discussed setting up quiet corners near the cat mural. Additionally, Andy mentioned they'd spoken to Caroline and Peter, who were eager to collaborate, and reminded Diego about taking care of stray animals before their meeting. They ended the conversation with a mutual agreement to support each other during the project and looking forward to seeing each other under the oak tree.",

And speaking of collaborations, have you heard about our cat mural project? Peter mentioned he enjoyed that minty latte we shared last week.\n\nCaroline: Oh, absolutely! I was just discussing that with him earlier today. I'm excited to see Mei's talent in action. We should definitely plan a meeting under the old oak tree soon.\n\nMei: That sounds wonderful! Let's make it this weekend, so I can bring Diego and introduce him to your fantastic lattes. Maybe we could even invite Andy for a double date?\n\nCaroline: Sounds like a plan! I'll prepare some chamomile lattes for everyone, and you can bring those labeled seedlings of yours too. Looking forward to it!",
