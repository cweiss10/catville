I heard he's quite excited about it!\nDiego: Yes, we had a quick chat yesterday. He's thrilled to be involved and can't wait to discuss his ideas further tonight.\n\nAndy: That sounds fantastic. I'm really looking forward to this project and the special day for our town. What do you think about Diego's kitten participating?\nDiego: Well, she's still a bit timid around strangers, but with Caroline and your encouragement, who knows? Maybe we can capture some purrfect moments!",
