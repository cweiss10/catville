They agreed to meet next week to discuss further details.\n\nAt 10:00 PM, Diego talked to Peter at the museum, who expressed interest in collaborating on a fitness-themed gallery show with Diego's fitness expertise, Caroline's music, and the zine club. They discussed involving Samantha in their collaborations as she has been talking about an AI project that might blend well with theirs.\n\nDiego also talked to Noor at the market around 8:00 AM about their collaborations.
