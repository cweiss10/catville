They discussed some unique ideas for the mural inspired by herbs from Mei's garden. Diego mentioned meeting with Leo the next day to discuss collaborations in more detail and shared that he had found improbable spare parts for one of their projects. Andy invited Diego to join him for lunch this weekend to discuss the mural project in detail, and they agreed to catch up after Diego's gym session tomorrow.

Have you met her yet?\n\nAndy: Not officially, but I know of her from the library. She sounds like a great addition to our team!\n\nNoor: Yes, definitely! She's involved with the theater and has suggested creating an interactive mini lab station for the mural. Let's grab coffee this Thursday to discuss further?\n\nAndy: That sounds wonderful, Noor.

Did you know Leo suggested an improvised musical touch from his zine club too?\n\nMei: That sounds fantastic! I'm glad we're on the same page. I can't wait for our yoga session at the community center this weekend – Peter agreed to suggest incorporating it into our fitness-themed art piece, right?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! And speaking of Peter, let's not forget feeding those stray animals at the park on Saturday as planned. After that, I was thinking we could meet Diego and you at his street taco gathering before heading over to your zine club meeting.\n\nMei: Perfect plan! I'm really looking forward to it all, Noor.
