It will certainly make our project unique. And speaking of unique, I thought we could discuss expanding our garden project with Noor's students too. What do you think?\n\nCaroline: Oh, that's a brilliant idea! Let's get Diego on board during our meeting tomorrow.

The street tacos are planned for after the event, and Peter offers suggestions for a place near the park.
