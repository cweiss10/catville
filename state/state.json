They also discuss integrating star constellation ideas from Diego into the mural, using sunrise seeds melodies, improvised instruments, and plan to meet at the cafe where they will share sketches and possibly run together beforehand. Andy mentions bringing his running shoes for the morning run, and Diego offers street tacos for the team.\n\nIn further conversations, Andy talks to Caroline at home around 4:00 PM. Andy brings sunrise seeds and tea for their mural project meeting. Caroline expresses her appreciation for Andy's thoughtfulness and the progress of the project. They discuss the sunrise seeds melody idea, which was Peter's suggestion, and plan to bring it up during their meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow. After the meeting, they plan to celebrate at Main Street Tacos.",
