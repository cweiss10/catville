Diego suggests Leo bring tea, a violin, and perhaps a kitten to keep spirits high during their discussion.\n\nLater, at around 4:00 AM, Leo talks to Noor at the theater. They discuss their respective projects - Leo's new violin piece inspired by city night sounds, and Noor's plans with the cat mural team at Caroline's cafe. Both agree that involving stray cats and adding music to their projects seems like they are on the same wavelength. Noor expresses enthusiasm about Leo bringing his kitten to their meetings, believing that his bird duets would be a perfect fit too.\n\nLeo looks forward to serenading Noor's latte art creations at Caroline's house tomorrow.
