How about we meet at Main Street Tacos tomorrow for further planning?\n\nSamantha: That sounds perfect. I'll bring my laptop and noise-cancelling headphones, just in case we need to sketch some ideas or go over technical details. Let's plan to meet at 10:30 AM, shall we?\n\nNoor: Great! Looking forward to it. And don't worry about the small talk, Samantha. You can leave me those kind notes instead if you prefer. See you tomorrow!",
