Diego offers help with performances and suggests setting up a 'cat feeding station' at El Charro as part of the project.\n\nAndy contacts Diego to discuss his sketches for their cat-themed ideas. They agree to meet after Diego's yoga session at Main Street Tacos, where Andy plans to capture the ambiance in his sketchbook. They also plan to discuss Samantha's violin improvisations, Noor's robotics club creations, and a quadruple date afterward. Peter joins the conversation with Andy, discussing their mural project, incorporating Leo and Noor's talents, and coordinating a yoga session before the performance as suggested by Andy. They are excited about the collaboration and believe it will bring out the best in all of them.",
