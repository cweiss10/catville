Leo suggested serving chamomile tea for the stray cats during our meetings there, don't you think it's a lovely idea?\n\nSamantha: It is, Mei. I've been meaning to ask – have you collected those sunrise seeds from Diego like we discussed with Noor? I'd love to use them in our cat mural project.\n\nMei: Yes, I did!
