I was also planning to invite Samantha and Peter for some fresh perspectives. Maybe we can have an interactive puzzle-solving session with their input too?\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic! Don't forget Leo's bird duet for the performance, I think they'd be a great addition. Let's grab tacos first before getting started, shall we?\n\nDiego: Agreed. See you tomorrow at 2 PM, then.\n\nNoor: Can't wait! And Diego, can we also discuss bringing headphones for focused discussions and inviting Caroline to our quadruple date?
