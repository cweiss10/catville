They agreed on the gym mats, chamomile lattes, street tacos, and collaborating further on the cat mural project.\n\nDuring a 3:00 PM conversation with Samantha at the gym, she expressed interest in joining the mechanical bird project and brought up some new libraries that could be useful. Diego agreed to meet under the old oak tree the next day as planned, also inviting her to contribute equipment if needed. They both looked forward to working together on making the project special.\n\nIn a 4:00 PM conversation with Noor at a cafe, Diego shared details of their plans for the mechanical bird project and double date under the old oak tree, which Noor expressed interest in joining. Peter had also planned to meet under that oak tree tonight at 7:30 PM with spicy tacos prepared by Samantha.
