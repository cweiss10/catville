Both were excited about the collaboration, looking forward to their upcoming meeting with fresh cups of tea, a double date at Main Street Tacos this weekend, and discussing the project further with Noor around 12:00 PM who praised its potential and suggested a double date and bringing cat food for Stray-13.",
