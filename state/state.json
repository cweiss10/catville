How about we meet at Main Street Tacos tomorrow for further planning?\n\nSamantha: That sounds perfect. I'll bring my laptop and noise-cancelling headphones, just in case we need to sketch some ideas or go over technical details. Let's plan to meet at 10:30 AM, shall we?\n\nNoor: Great! Looking forward to it. And don't worry about the small talk, Samantha. You can leave me those kind notes instead if you prefer. See you tomorrow!",

I also spoke to Diego at the market today, he's interested in joining us and suggested involving his robotics club as well. We should definitely discuss this further at our meeting tomorrow.
