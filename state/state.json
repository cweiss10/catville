At a cafe around 10:00 PM, Andy learns that Caroline will bring fresh mint tea for the gathering under the old oak tree later that day, and Diego suggests bringing Whiskers' brother's designs ready for review beforehand.\n\nIn separate conversations, Andy talks about the tea party with Peter at the hospital at 10:00 AM, who agrees to bring fresh mint tea. They also discuss an upcoming coffee meeting with Peter and express excitement for their collaborative cat mural project. Andy talks to Diego at the gym around 4:00 PM about joining the tea party meeting.\n\nIn further conversations, Andy invites Mei to join the tea party under the old oak tree around 6:00 AM, and they discuss incorporating mechanical birds from her robotics club, involving Samantha's class, and asking Diego to join them. They also agree on collaborating with Whiskers' brother in the project and plan a surprise appearance at the meeting. Andy learns that Mei suggests inviting Noor for the gathering and discusses label ideas for the cat mural project. They are looking forward to it as a special day for their town, with Caroline bringing street tacos and Diego's kitten potentially participating.\n\nIn another conversation at the museum around 10:00 AM, Andy invites Mei to collaborate on the cat mural project, which includes her zine club. Mei accepts, expressing excitement for the collaboration and considering it an amazing opportunity.",
