The group also plans to collaborate on incorporating sunrise seeds into mural design and improv performance in their meeting at the library tomorrow.\n\nIn separate conversations, Andy discusses these ideas with Caroline at a park around 11:00 AM, later with Mei at the theater around 2:00 PM, and Peter at the town_hall around 10:00 PM. They all express enthusiasm for the additions to the project, agreeing that sunrise seeds could make a unique touch to the mural design and improv performance. They also plan to invite Mei to join them for brainstorming tunes for the gazebo, provide chamomile tea for stray cats at the event, and discuss incorporating sunrise seeds in their squirrel latte design. Peter suggests inviting Mei for their next meeting as well. Andy informs Peter about his improved condition from his knee injury and mentions that Diego would like to share his expertise at Andy's gym during the singing session at the gazebo.",

At 2:00 PM at school, Caroline talked to Samantha about the upcoming dinner collaboration on the cat mural project. Around 4:00 PM at the hospital, Caroline spoke with Mei about her sprouting seeds from the zine club garden and discussed their cat mural design. They agreed to include sunrise seeds in the mural, connect more projects, and involve Leo for an improv music performance at a symphony under the oak tree. Later that evening, Caroline talked to Mei at the market around 7:00 PM. Mei was glad the sunrise seeds were bringing joy to their community, and Caroline informed her about the meeting with Peter and Andy for the cat mural project, inviting Mei to join them. Mei agreed to bring seeds for everyone and expressed a desire to work together to ensure their town thrives.",
