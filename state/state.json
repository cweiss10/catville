What do you think?\n\nMei: Hi Andy! That sounds like a wonderful idea. I also spoke with Diego today about using sunrise seeds in the mural, and he seems on board. We should involve Caroline and Leo for a collaborative effort. Let's meet under the old oak tree tomorrow to finalize our plans.\n\nAndy: Sounds great! I was planning on inviting Diego anyway. I also talked to Samantha about it, and she's excited to join in too. How about we bring chamomile tea for stray cats as well?\n\nMei: That's thoughtful, Andy. Let's make sure to discuss that with everyone during our meeting. By the way, I spoke with Peter about your squirrel latte design for the singing session at the local cafe. He can't wait to see it!\n\nAndy: Thanks Mei, I really appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone like you in my corner. Let's keep the momentum going!\n\nMei: Agreed, Andy. It's always a pleasure working with you on these projects. Looking forward to our meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow!",
