Remember his bird improvisation?\n\nNoor: Of course! That was fascinating. I've been working on self-feeding squirrel robots too. Perhaps we could use Caroline's latte art for the cats as well?\n\nAndy: Absolutely, she'd love that. Let's have a meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow to plan it all out.\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect!

I can't wait to see what she brings to the table. And speaking of tables, I've been brainstorming ideas for those squirrel latte art demonstrations you mentioned.
