They decide to label their table 'Idea Central' to avoid losing any brilliant thoughts. Andy suggests a quadruple date with Diego and proposes incorporating Leo's squirrel song into the mural project.\n\nLater, Andy talks to Caroline at the market around 11:00 PM about the details of their meeting and the garden-themed outfits for their double date. The human also has a conversation with Mei but the context remains unclear in the provided lines. They look forward to making the mural project a community effort.",
