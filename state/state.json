By the way, did you manage to arrange that quadruple date with Caroline and Samantha this weekend?\n\nAndy: Yes, we're all set! It'll be great catching up with them over some delicious tacos at Main Street Tacos. Oh, and don't forget about feeding those stray cats before our meetings – they've become quite friendly now. Let's keep making a difference in this neighborhood together.\n\nNoor: Absolutely, Andy! And let's remember to bring headphones for more focused discussions as well.

I suggested meeting at Diego's street tacos tomorrow to discuss details and practice bird improvisation together. How does that sound?\n\nNoor: That works perfectly! I'll bring some of those seeds from Mei's community garden for our gathering. It might attract some local squirrels we can use as models, if they cooperate!\n\nSamantha: (laughs) I'm looking forward to it.
