I was thinking about that cat mural project we talked about, and I thought it might be cool if we could incorporate your students' art too.\n\nNoor: Hi Peter! That sounds like a fantastic idea. I'll have to check my schedule, but I think they'd love to be involved. By the way, I spoke with Andy last night and we're planning a post-performance yoga session led by Diego for the event. Would that work for you?\n\nPeter: Absolutely! In fact, I suggested to Mei that she could create latte art inspired by cats and maybe even some yoga poses too. She seems pretty excited about it. We're meeting up tomorrow at Main Street Tacos to discuss everything. Wanna join us?\n\nNoor: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Count me in. I was also thinking we could save some treats for the neighborhood cats during our meeting, just as you mentioned. Maybe we can collaborate on that too?\n\nPeter: Absolutely! I'm really looking forward to working with you more on this project and other community initiatives. Let's make it a special event for everyone involved.",
