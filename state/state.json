They discuss plans for a meeting with Diego regarding their yoga session details after Mei's Saturday zine club. Leo brings up Samantha, who he believes could be helpful with the mural. Mei suggests she might be interested, and they both agree they have a busy week ahead. Lastly, Mei reminds Leo to feed the stray animals before heading out for their park meeting on Saturday.",
