Caroline discusses the mural design at a cafe with Noor and proposes involving Leo in their meeting under the old oak tree to finalize plans for the cat mural and the zine club collaboration. In a separate 9 PM conversation with Peter at home, Caroline learns that Samantha is collaborating with Leo on music for the performance, and Mei has joined the team. Later, Caroline meets Andy at the library around 10:00 PM to discuss the cat mural project with Diego and Mei, sharing her idea of chamomile latte art in their design. They decide to collaborate over tea, looking forward to another successful collaboration between friends.",

Samantha agreed to meet at that time with her noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nIn a later conversation at the cafe around 11:00 AM, Leo spoke with Noor and learned about their separate meetings to brainstorm latte art ideas for the bird design. They decided to collaborate and set up a meeting at the park near the old oak tree around 8:00 AM the next day to discuss further details and brainstorm. Noor agreed to bring snacks as well.
