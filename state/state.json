Samantha expressed her excitement about their meeting at the café that night and suggested bringing headphones and a violin. Leo confirmed his preparation for the duet and shared that he had been practicing some melodies. Samantha revealed she had prepared a logic puzzle to help with the bird mural, which excited Leo.
