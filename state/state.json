She appreciates my dedication to this project. Have you tried those street tacos I recommended?\n\nLeo: Not yet, but I heard they're fantastic! Once we finish rehearsing, maybe we can grab some lunch together and catch up on each other's projects. It'd be good to hear more about your knee injury too.\n\nDiego: Sounds like a plan, Leo.
