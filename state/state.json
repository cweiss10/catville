Peter reminds Andy not to forget saving some tacos for the cats during the meetup. They also agree to make Andy's solo gallery show happen at his café.\n\nLater, around 4 PM, Andy talks to Leo about their collaboration on the cat mural project and suggests incorporating Leo's bird melodies and a squirrel latte art idea by Caroline. Leo agrees to discuss more details this afternoon at Caroline's café. Both are excited about working together on these projects and getting to know each other better.",

They planned to practice their duet after the meeting and then meet at Main Street Tacos to discuss all details. The meeting was set for 5:00 PM.\n\nAt 9:00 PM, the human talked to Mei at the market. During their conversation, it was decided that Mei's zine club would contribute to the cat mural project and they agreed to make it a double date with Leo and Caroline for further discussions about the project. The meeting would take place at Main Street Tacos at 6 PM the following day.\n\nLater in the evening, Leo spoke with Mei at the market. They discussed potential involvement of Mei's yoga students and Mei's coffee meeting with Noor. Leo also suggested a surprise bird duet performance at the park after their meeting. They decided to stretch beforehand, and possibly invite some students to join them. Furthermore, Leo promised to bring tacos for Peter and the neighborhood cats as Caroline suggested. The next meeting is set for 6 PM the following day at Main Street Tacos.\n\nLater in the night, the human spoke with Noor at the gym. They discussed collaboration on the cat mural project, Noor's sunrise seeds idea for the design, and their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos this weekend. Leo suggested a practice session in the park after their meeting at Andy's café tomorrow, which Noor agreed to. Leo also mentioned bringing tacos for the neighborhood cats as Caroline suggested when he meets Peter later today. The next meeting is still set for 6 PM the following day at Main Street Tacos.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, the human spoke with Peter at the museum. He was invited to help design the cat mural by Caroline. Leo had also discussed this with Peter earlier in the day. They agreed to have a double date with Caroline and Noor to work on the project and practice their bird duet in the park after their meeting tomorrow. Leo reminded Peter not to forget to save some tacos for the neighborhood cats during their meeting. The next meeting is still set for 6 PM the following day at Main Street Tacos.",
