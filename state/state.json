Diego updates Andy about his knee injury recovery progress during their hospital conversation, and they decide to meet at the train station that night to continue planning. At the train station around 11:00 PM, Andy meets with Mei, who expresses excitement over Andy's cat feeding station idea for El Charro's event. They discuss collaborating on a mural project and agree to work together.\n\nMei suggests a quadruple date in the park and mentions her students working on a mural project as well. Andy proposes bringing his sketchbook to their next meeting, and they plan to catch up more at Main Street Tacos soon. During their conversation, Caroline introduces a yoga session with cat poses and music elements, suggested by Samantha. Diego proposes blending routines with an art and science theme and suggests having a cat-themed concert. They also decide to meet for street tacos at Main Street Tacos this Thursday before their meeting and discuss adding a stray cat feeding session after the yoga session as a way to give back to the community. The collaborators are excited about their creative collaboration and aim to make the event something special for their town.",

What a great addition!\n\nPeter: Absolutely! It seems like everyone is on board, which is awesome. Let's make this project something special, Noor.\n\nNoor: Agreed, Peter. Let's meet up tomorrow to finalize the plans and bring this idea to life. Oh, and I have some snacks for you if you get hungry during our meeting.\n\nPeter: That sounds perfect, Noor. And I must say, your energy and enthusiasm are contagious. I feel like we make a great team.\n\nNoor: Well, thank you, Peter. I think we complement each other well. Let's continue to inspire one another as we bring our ideas to life.",

Leo proposes merging their projects and suggests meeting at Main Street Tacos later in the week to discuss further plans. Peter also informs Leo that his amp repair is nearly complete and encourages him to show it off during their meeting.\n\nDiego and Peter suggest involving Leo's students in their music session at Main Street Tacos, and Leo agrees.
