Later, Andy talks to Caroline at the park who had missed him by a few hours earlier and proposes including Noor in their quadruple date with Peter. Andy also invites Diego for planting sunrise seeds for stray cats in the evening.\n\nIn separate conversations, Andy discusses these plans with Noor and Diego, agreeing on dinner at Main Street Tacos before their brainstorming session under the gazebo, with Noor suggesting they bring binoculars to spot park birds while they work.

Speaking of collaboration, have you talked to Samantha about the cat mural patterns yet? We should make sure they align with our theme.\n\nCaroline: Yes, we did discuss it earlier today. But you're right, we should coordinate better to ensure a seamless blend between the latte art and mural. Let's touch base with her tomorrow morning before the quadruple date at Main Street Tacos. I'm excited for this project, Diego!\n\nDiego: Me too, Caroline. It's going to be something special.

She suggested incorporating hazelnut and cinnamon into the blend and reminded him about involving birds in their duet performance. Caroline also invited Leo to a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos the next day at 5 PM, where they could meet Andy who had suggested sunrise seeds for their cat mural design. Leo agreed and promised to bring his violin for their event under the gazebo, just like old times.\n\nAt around 9:00 PM, Leo spoke with Caroline at the theater. She offered him a swan latte with extra honey, and he suggested a duet at the gazebo the next morning before sunrise. Caroline informed him about her meeting with Peter regarding some projects and the cat mural event this weekend. Leo expressed his excitement for the squirrel latte contest and praised Caroline for their collaborations, to which she responded by acknowledging Leo's role as a catalyst for their collaborations.",
