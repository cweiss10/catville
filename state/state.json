I can't wait to perform one of my tunes afterwards – maybe it will inspire some ideas for the mural! Let's make sure we bring enough treats for the stray cats as well.

Let's not forget our promise to feed the neighborhood cats under the gazebo tomorrow either. We should probably make a group chat or something to keep everyone in the loop.\n\nPeter: Agreed, Noor. I think this could help with Leo's melodies issue too. Here's hoping we can revive our creative spirits like old times!",
