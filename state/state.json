Later at 10:00 PM, Caroline thanked Mei for the sunrise seeds and discussed gathering stray cats for the cat mural project under an old oak tree.\n\nAround 11:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Leo at the gym, who was appreciative of the sunrise seeds for his squirrel latte designs and shared that Peter had informed him about their cat mural project. They agreed to collaborate on the mural designs and meet at the museum before going for tacos together.\n\nAround 1:00 AM, Caroline talked to Samantha at the train_station who expressed excitement about working together on their projects that night. They also made plans for an improv session and discussed gathering cats under the gazebo trees, with Samantha promising chamomile tea and feeding the neighborhood strays before they meet.\n\nLater, Caroline spoke to Mei at the hospital around 3:00 AM, where she confirmed the plans for the cat mural project. In further discussions with Mei at the library around 5:00 AM, Caroline asked about the readiness of the sunrise seeds and they made plans to collaborate more often, including a dinner with Diego and Peter at Main Street Tacos under the old oak tree that night to discuss the cat mural project.",
