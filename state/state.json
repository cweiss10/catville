Andy asks Caroline about a latte meeting with Samantha, expressing his need for inspiration for his sketches. Caroline agrees and suggests swapping ideas after Andy finishes his sketches, offering a chamomile latte from the café on her. Andy accepts the offer and plans to swing by the following afternoon. Both parties look forward to their meeting and creating magic together.\n\nOn the same day at 3:00 PM, Andy initiates a conversation with Samantha at the hospital where she works. He thanks her for joining their art crew and expresses confidence in her programming skills as an asset to the cat mural project. Samantha reciprocates enthusiasm and agrees to help with the design and logistics of the project. They share a smile as they prepare for their meeting under the old oak tree.",
