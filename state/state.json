Andy checks if Mei received the seeds and cat treats he dropped off earlier, which she confirms. They discuss their upcoming collaboration meeting tomorrow at Main Street Tacos for the cat mural project. Andy shares some great ideas for the bird duet design and gym routines for the mural that Diego is excited about. Mei expresses her excitement for the collaboration and looks forward to seeing it all come together. She also mentions having snacks for the gazebo cats.

They plan to make the evening special by having Noor's updates, rehearsing their bird duet for a performance, and enjoying snacks brought by Mei. Additionally, Andy will get cat food from Diego beforehand. All participants express enthusiasm about the night ahead and look forward to making their town proud with this endeavor.\n\nAt 1 AM, Noor talks to Caroline at her café where she reveals that she's also been discussing the project with Diego. They are both eager to join and collaborate on community art. Caroline proposes a pre-rehearsal coffee catch-up for added inspiration before their meeting under the gazebo. Noor agrees, looking forward to joining Caroline at her café.\n\nLater in the day at around 9:00 AM, Peter and Noor discuss plans for the brainstorming session at Peter's place that night. Noor offers noise-cancelling headphones if needed and suggests grabbing dinner beforehand, specifically street tacos they've been meaning to try. Peter agrees, looking forward to a successful night for both art and their community.",
