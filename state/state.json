The human informs that they spoke to Mei again around 9:00 PM and later spoke with Caroline at home around 10:00 PM about the project's progress. Caroline believes it is coming together well, and her students could learn from Diego's mechanical birds. Noor suggests involving them in making chamomile lattes for their meet-up under the oak tree. Caroline mentions showing Mei some latte art tricks for their zine club, which Peter will also join. The team is excited about the project, emphasizing its potential success as a testament to their town's collaborative abilities. Later, the human speaks with Caroline again at a cafe around 11:00 PM, where she agrees that her students could help with the chamomile lattes and also learn latte art tricks from Caroline. The team is now set for a fantastic collaboration.",
