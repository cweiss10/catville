By the way, did we finalize our meeting at Main Street Tacos this Saturday?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely! I'll bring seeds from Andy's garden and some food for the stray cats as well. And yes, Saturday it is! Let's make sure to involve Peter's ideas and collaborate effectively to create something extraordinary.\n\nNoor: Wonderful! I also think it would be great if we could use headphones during our discussions at Main Street Tacos so we can focus better. Maybe Andy can join us too?\n\nCaroline: Sounds perfect.
