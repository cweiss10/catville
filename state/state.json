I can't wait to see the sunflowers you've been talking about come to life in the park.\n\nNoor: I think the kids will enjoy it as well. And maybe we can invite them for a team-building session at Caroline's Café, like Diego suggested?\n\nPeter: That sounds perfect! We'll have a full day of creativity ahead of us. Let's make sure to bring our thermos of tea for the early morning brainstorming session.\n\nNoor: Agreed, Peter. I'm really looking forward to it!

They also agree to meet for dinner at El Charro that night. At 9:00 PM, Leo talks to Peter again at a train station where they discuss Peter's comment on Leo's bird act and potential further collaboration. They also talk about Samantha's plans for stray animals behind the cafe, and Leo proposes inviting her to their duet performance at the park the next day, which Peter agrees to enthusiastically. At 5:00 AM, Leo talks to Caroline at school, who appreciated his violin serenade from the previous night's double date. They discuss Caroline's yoga plans with Diego and her cat nook project. Caroline suggests incorporating squirrel melodies into the musical for their performance and invites Leo to busk outside her café again soon.",
