Peter suggested making it a community event at the theater, including chamomile lattes, quiet spaces, and collaborations. Around 6:00 PM, Andy spoke with Peter again who proposed inviting everyone, including Mei and Caroline, to make a day of it. Andy agreed and asked Leo about street tacos for lunch. At 7:00 PM, Andy talked to Mei, who enthusiastically agreed to involve her crew in the project and expand collaborative events. They decided to add a cat mural and discussed providing quiet spaces as well. Both looked forward to making this event bring their town together and create something special, just like old times.",

And speaking of which, have you thought about the cat mural at the library? It could be a great addition to the book corner.\n\nMei: That's a wonderful idea! I'll get the zine club members involved. By the way, have you set up that tea party under the old oak tree yet?\n\nNoor: Yes, Leo and I have invited everyone. We thought street tacos at Samantha's beforehand would make it even more fun. You should bring Andy and his cat too!\n\nMei: It'll be great to catch up with them, Noor. Your energy always brings a smile to my day. See you there!\n\nNoor: Can't wait, Mei! Let's work together to make these events memorable and strengthen our friendships further.",

They decided to have a tea party under the old oak tree, with mechanical birds serenading them and inviting Andy with his sketches and Caroline for her contributions to the bird melodies.\n\nLater, Leo spoke to Peter at the hospital around 5:00 AM where they discussed bringing books to the library meeting tomorrow for inspiration. Leo also suggested he would bring his violin for improvisation at their tea party under the oak tree. They further agreed that Peter could work on a self-help book while incorporating Leo's mechanical birds, making it a true symphony of art and ideas.",
