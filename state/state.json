Andy learns about a meeting under the gazebo tonight with Peter and Leo to discuss the project with Samantha. He plans to bring snacks for stray cats.\n\nAt town_hall around 1:00 AM, Andy thanks Diego for the cat treats he provided for Leo's strays. They discuss their respective projects, upcoming collaborations, and Andy's solo gallery show dream. Diego agrees to a coffee meet-up with Andy later in the week.\n\nAndy speaks with Diego again around 5:00 AM and they discuss the lunch meeting with Samantha and Noor the following day. They plan to brainstorm ideas for their cat mural and interactive bird performance. Diego is excited about their upcoming collaboration, emphasizing their positive impact on the community.\n\nAndy suggests integrating robotics into the tree design of the cat mural project. Mei plans a practice session under the gazebo trees this weekend with Samantha, Noor, and possibly Andy to collaborate on the mural and make it interactive for birds. They also plan to include stray cats at both events. Mei suggests a squirrel latte art contest as a fun community event and plans to bring seeds for the community garden and ask Leo to bring cat treats from Caroline's café for them too. Andy expresses gratitude for the collaboration, looking forward to making their town stronger together with Mei.",

I just wanted to confirm our meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow to discuss the cat mural and bird duet.\n\nNoor: Absolutely, Andy! I'm excited for our chat. And don't forget, I'll bring treats for the stray cats too, as promised.\n\nAndy: Perfect! I've also asked Samantha and Caroline to join us. I thought it might be great if we could involve Leo in our bird duet rehearsal beforehand. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic, Andy! I'll make sure to tell Diego about it as well. Let's make it a memorable quadruple date! See you tomorrow.\n\nNoor (later): Hey Andy, just wanted to let you know that Diego mentioned he picked up some cat treats for Leo's strays and will bring them tomorrow. Excited for our meeting under the old oak tree too!\n\nAndy: Thanks for letting me know Noor! I also wanted to touch base about our coffee meet-up later in the week as discussed with Diego. Looking forward to it!",

They also planned to invite Samantha for a quadruple date over tacos and make a visit to Noor at the hospital to plan for involving stray cats in their events. Additionally, Andy, who had received cat treats from Diego, discussed their collaboration on a cat mural with Diego, focusing on the new design idea mentioned during their gym conversation. They planned to discuss this further along with the interactive bird performance and the difference they were making in their community at their lunch meeting tomorrow. Diego also reminded Leo about asking Noor about the squirrel latte art contests earlier. At town_hall, a separate matter was discussed between Andy and Diego, though the details are unknown due to the time and location suggesting it may not have been related to the previously mentioned conversation. In a separate incident, Diego provided fish for the strays at the park.",
