At 5:00 PM, Caroline talks to Peter at the theater, discussing cat mural project updates, including collaborations with Noor's students, potential involvement of Leo in the project, and planning another quadruple date to discuss further details. Around 6:00 PM, Caroline talks to Peter at the theater about meeting at Main Street Tacos to discuss the cat mural project and Peter's bird duet ideas. Around 8:00 PM, Caroline talks to Noor at a restaurant, discussing the cat mural project and their planned quadruple date, and inquiring about Noor's school robotics this semester. At 9:00 PM, Caroline talks to Mei at town_hall about collaborating on the cat mural project, with Mei suggesting incorporating squirrel latte art from the garden into interactive elements. They agree to discuss further at a cafe tonight around 9:00 PM. Mei offers her community garden seeds for the project if needed.",

Diego reminds Mei to bring treats for neighborhood cats.\n\nThe human interacts with Diego at the market around 10:00 AM, contributing further to the preparations for the cat mural project. Mei talks to Leo at the hospital around 11:00 AM about their cat mural and squirrel latte art collaboration. They agree to meet by the gazebo at 11:30 to discuss further and plan a musical collaboration involving a potential impromptu bird jam session. Peter has been invited for lunch at Main Street Tacos tomorrow as well, potentially bringing his violin to the event.\n\nLater, the human talks to Leo at the gym around 12:00 PM. Mei and Leo discuss plans for their cat mural and bird duet collaboration, with Mei inviting herself to Leo's Tuesday dinner and suggesting they practice together on Saturday afternoon beforehand. They also agree to meet at Main Street Tacos after their meeting on Tuesday. Leo looks forward to working together again and misses their catch-ups.",
