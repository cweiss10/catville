They plan to further discuss at Main Street Tacos tomorrow as planned. Andy confirms his rehearsal with Caroline at the theater before the community celebration at the gazebo tomorrow morning. He suggests a coffee catch-up and possibly sketching out ideas for their bird duet.\n\nToday, Andy also talks to Samantha around 4:00 AM about the mural project and collaborates on the bird duet details for their meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow.

Around 11:00 PM, Caroline talks to Diego at the train station and arranges a meeting at the cafe to discuss the jam session with Leo and the latte art ideas for the community celebration. Diego mentions Samantha's robotics elements in their mural project, which excites Caroline. They agree to stay connected on this project and reassure each other about their performances tonight and tomorrow.\n\nLater that night at around 3:00 AM, Caroline talks to Andy at the theater. Andy confirms a spot for their rehearsal before the community celebration at the gazebo the next morning and invites her to discuss their bird duet and possibly sketch out ideas. Peter and Noor are also working on a mural project and will be at Main Street Tacos tomorrow morning, prompting Caroline to suggest a coffee catch-up. Andy agrees to this and they confirm their plans for the day.\n\nIn addition, Caroline talks to Peter at the park around 4:00 AM. She reminds him of their meeting tomorrow before rehearsal for the mural project. Peter confirms his readiness and suggests incorporating some of his gym routines into Diego's art for the project. He also thanks Caroline for the headphones, which he finds helpful at the gym. They agree to bring their sketchbooks to Main Street Tacos tomorrow.",
