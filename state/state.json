They also planned to incorporate science elements into the design, invite kids from the community center to participate in a bird duet performance, and collaborate with Andy on latte art.\n\nCaroline spoke with Mei at the library around 5:00 AM and invited her to join their meeting at Main Street Tacos that night to discuss the cat mural project further. Mei proposed involving Noor from the zine club in a brainstorming session under the gazebo trees the following day, which Caroline agreed to. They also discussed using noise-cancelling headphones for their discussions and planting sunrise seeds around the gazebo trees to make the event even more memorable.",

They agreed to make it a quadruple date with Diego, Samantha, and Mei. Additionally, they decided to use sunrise seeds as a tradition during their gatherings and discussed bringing seeds for the stray cats behind the cafe.
