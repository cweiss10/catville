They agreed to meet under the oak tree at Caroline's Cafe tomorrow morning, with Leo bringing headphones and chamomile tea, while Diego promised a new spicy taco recipe.\n\nIn an 8:00 PM conversation at the town hall, Samantha appreciated Leo's improvisations with birds for their shared project at Caroline's Cafe.
