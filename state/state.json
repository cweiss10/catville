At 9:00 AM, they met again at the museum where Caroline complimented Leo on his bird duet improv at the park. Leo then invited Caroline to try Diego's famous cat food samples and hinted at a surprise for Stray-13 related to their projects. Caroline mentioned meeting with Noor that night to discuss the cat mural, possibly involving Diego in the cat food sampling. They also discussed collaborating on music with Peter under the old oak tree, as they both eagerly anticipate upcoming events.\n\nAt 1:00 PM, Caroline spoke with Andy at a café. Andy informed her that their cat mural project is gaining momentum and shared that he had productive discussions with Mei, Leo, and Noor. Caroline offered some samples for Stray-13 that Diego had dropped off, planning to meet with Andy later that night under the old oak tree to discuss everything in detail. Andy also shared his plans for an indie performance and expressed gratitude towards Caroline for taking care of Stray-13.",
