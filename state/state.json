Let's make our town even more special together!\n\nAndy: Absolutely, Noor! See you tonight at the tacos place then. And by the way, have you heard about our group modifying plans for the cat mural project tomorrow? We're meeting at 10 AM sharp instead of 9 AM, bringing yoga mats and discussing ideas for the design.\n\nNoor: Yes, I did!
