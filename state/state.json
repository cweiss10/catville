He also mentioned inviting Diego, Caroline, and more team members for a discussion under the gazebo the day after.\n\nLater, Andy suggested incorporating Leo's violin melodies into the cat mural project during a conversation at the train station around 12:00 PM with Leo. They agreed to gather at the old oak tree or the gazebo, and also invited Peter and Mei to join. Both parties looked forward to a grand collaboration under the oak tree.",
