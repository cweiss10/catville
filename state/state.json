        "summary": " At 9:00 AM, Leo discusses his successful busking performance with Mei at home and plans a mural project involving Noor, whose unique style would complement theirs. They arrange a meeting with Diego about the yoga session details after Mei's Saturday zine club. Samantha is suggested for the mural project, and they both agree on a busy week ahead. Leo also remembers to feed stray animals before their park meeting on Saturday.\n\nAt 12:00 PM, Leo talks to Andy at a restaurant. Andy proposes double-dating with Diego this weekend, which Leo agrees to and suggests visiting Andy's gallery show as part of the plans. Andy offers a sneak peek of his artwork if asked nicely. Leo mentions he has some improbable spare parts for their projects and promises to use them wisely.\n\nLater in the day, around 1:00 PM, Diego asks Leo about herbs from Mei's garden for their mural project, and Leo suggests mint and lavender. Leo also informs Diego that he has found the improbable spare parts Diego was looking for in his violin case. Diego is impressed, and they plan to meet for street tacos tomorrow after Diego's gym session. Leo suggests making it a double date with Caroline. Additionally, they discuss joining Peter's meeting with Mei at the park on Wednesday.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, Leo talks to Andy at a cafe. Andy is surprised to see Leo early and proposes lunch together this weekend to discuss their mural project in detail. They also plan to involve Noor in yoga experiments and robotics for the children's part of the mural. Leo looks forward to brainstorming sessions with Noor this weekend, hoping for a successful community project. Andy offers to show his artwork and suggests inviting Diego and Caroline on their double date.",
