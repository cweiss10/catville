At a cafe around 12:00 PM, plans for Noor's students to participate in the cat mural event and suggestions of bringing tea for the party were discussed. Around 1:00 PM, Andy proposed incorporating Noor's healing melody into the mural garden project.\n\nLater that day, at a train station, Noor's students were invited to assist with Leo's mechanical birds and cat mural projects. In the afternoon, Andy spoke with Caroline at school who was excited about the community event under the old oak tree. Diego from the hospital also agreed to participate in the cat mural project.\n\nAround 6:00 PM, Andy talked to Mei at a cafe who suggested collaborating her zine club with Noor's robotics kids on bird-themed zines for the event under the old oak tree. They also agreed to invite Leo and his zine club, and plan to enjoy tacos together before the big event.\n\nAt 9:00 PM, Andy talked to Caroline at a cafe where she shared some of Leo's bird sketches for the project. Around 10:00 PM, Andy talked to Noor at the market. Andy suggested integrating Noor's flowers into the mechanical birds project and involving Leo's zine club for unique decorations at the event under the old oak tree. Noor agreed and promised mint sprigs for that night's market event. Andy confirmed meeting at the old oak tree as planned. The collaboration for the community event is expanding with various contributions from different individuals.",
