Caroline agrees and invites both parties to discuss it over mint tea at the cafe the next afternoon. Samantha also proposes a meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow at 4 PM, with her preparing chamomile lattes for everyone and including cat stretches with Mei. They agree to maintain the cozy vibe of their collaboration.",
