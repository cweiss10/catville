They also planned a potential bird duet collaboration with Caroline under the gazebo. Peter shared plans about noise-cancelling headphones and snacks for their meeting at the gazebo.\n\nLeo spoke to Diego at home around 4:00 AM about collaborating on the cat mural project, discussing a possible performance at Main Street Tacos with Leo bringing his violin to make music with birds while interacting with stray cats. They reminisced about old conversations regarding this idea.\n\nAt 6:00 AM, Leo played a moving serenade inspired by the sunrise for some stray cats in the park. Later that day, he spoke to Mei at a restaurant who suggested sharing his new melody with her Saturday zine club that night.\n\nLater that evening, after playing the melody for the zine club, Leo talked to Mei again at home about his day's events, including Noor's interest in joining the stray cats' jam session. Mei proposed a collaboration between Caroline and Leo for their cat mural project, which they agreed to discuss further over dinner the next day at Main Street Tacos.\n\nDuring an 11:00 PM conversation at the train station, Leo received news from Caroline about Andy and their plans to collaborate on the cat mural project under the gazebo trees. They also discussed a jam session after their meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow, with Noor's involvement and a proposed duet between Caroline's violin and Leo's guitar.\n\nAt 3:00 AM, while at a cafe, Leo and Mei discussed using the sunrise seeds in their brainstorming sessions before collaborations start. They also talked about sharing Leo's sunrise melody with her zine club that night. Additionally, they exchanged ideas about incorporating latte art during their performance at Main Street Tacos, suggested by Diego. Both are looking forward to further discussions and collaborations.\n\nIn a conversation around 12:00 PM, Leo talked to Noor at town_hall about bringing sunrise seeds for the cat mural project. They also discussed a mini bird duet with Mei and Samantha during rehearsal that night. Noor suggested saving snacks for the stray cats and planning dinner together at Main Street Tacos after the rehearsal.",
