Yes, I did. They were delicious as always. By the way, I brought some for you too if you have a moment after our talk. I've been thinking about our mural project and had an idea related to those sunflowers Caroline mentioned.\n\nDiego: Oh, fantastic! Sunflowers could be a great addition. Let's discuss it at the community garden today, and maybe you can show me your ideas. I also wanted to run something by you – how about we incorporate stretching exercises for the team during our work sessions? Plus, I've been working on a squirrel song idea that might fit well with your robotics project.\n\nNoor: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Diego! Let's definitely collaborate more on these ideas and take things to the next level. Speaking of collaboration, have you heard about Caroline's Café hosting a team-building event for us? I thought it could be a perfect opportunity to help stray cats while discussing project details.\n\nDiego: Now that's something I can definitely get behind! It sounds like a purrfect idea. I'll make sure to join you there. By the way, we should catch up at Main Street Tacos later tonight since it seems we have another meeting opportunity. Oh, and how about that quadruple date? When are we setting it up?\n\nNoor: Absolutely! Let's meet at Main Street Tacos as planned to work out the details for our collaborative projects. Regarding the date, I think Samantha suggested Friday evening. Sounds good to me – I can't wait to catch up with everyone over some delicious tacos and good company.",

Leo agrees and suggests Peter brings his self-help books for motivation. Peter also mentions that Leo could compose music inspired by the mural.\n\nLeo also reminds Peter about his new duet for their squirrel-themed performance at the park concert, and Peter looks forward to hearing Caroline's improvisations with birds as well.

We should collaborate on that squirrel song soon.\n\nPeter: Agreed, Leo. The squirrel song might just be the breakthrough we need for the cat art project. Let's discuss it over dinner at El Charro tonight. Say, have you heard about Samantha's plans for strays behind the cafe?\n\nLeo: Yes, I did. She seems quite passionate about animals, and I like that in a partner. By the way, I've been thinking... would you mind if I invite her to our duet tomorrow at the park?\n\nPeter: Not at all, Leo! In fact, I think it'd be great. She could add some lovely harmony to our act. Thanks for looking out for us. Let's make this collaboration count!",
