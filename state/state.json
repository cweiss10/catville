They agreed to meet again later that day at the museum, bringing chamomile lattes and seeds for Caroline's garden, respectively. During this meeting, they shared exciting updates on their project – Mei plans to collaborate with Diego on mechanical birds, while Andy will bring mint tea, and Diego might bring street tacos. Both look forward to a memorable evening under the old oak tree.\n\nAt 8:00 PM, Andy met up with Mei at the museum and presented his sketchbook for brainstorming ideas for their mural project. Mei offered to brew chamomile tea from Diego's batch, and they discussed inviting Noor and her choir to perform during the event. They hoped this collaboration would be a memorable night for the community and potentially inspire more collaborative projects in their town.\n\nAt 9:00 PM, Andy spoke to Samantha at the museum, further discussing the mural project and planning details.",

The group made plans to meet with Samantha at the market in the morning and later collaborate with her on their city sounds project at a cafe the following day. Additionally, there were plans to meet with Mei at the town hall and Diego at the market, and later catch up with Noor at the library. In the evening of the same day, Leo met Caroline at the cafe where they discussed city sounds for their mechanical bird project. They decided to invite Mei and Diego to join them under the old oak tree that night for a collaborative session. Later in the conversation, Diego informed Leo that he was ready to meet him, along with their plans for street tacos and a violin duet under the old oak tree. Diego also mentioned bringing mint tea and seedlings for Caroline's garden. Both agreed it would be a special project for their community.",
