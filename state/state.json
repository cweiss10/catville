The meeting is scheduled for the following day, preceded by a tea gathering between Caroline and Leo. Both decide to meet at the community garden tomorrow to finalize details and discuss further. Additionally, they make plans for a special night under the old oak tree with music, mechanical birds, and possibly a live kitten, after their group workout.

The plan includes inviting Mei's students to create mechanical birds and logic puzzles, planning a communal tea party under the old oak tree, and inviting Leo for a jam session. The following day, Caroline talks to Mei at the hospital about the project details, who agrees to bring her sketchbook the next day. At 4:00 PM on the same day, Caroline talks to Andy at a cafe. He confirms that Diego is also involved and expresses excitement for the project, particularly the mechanical birds idea. Andy also mentions that Diego had informed him about the involvement of Mei's students. Caroline further suggests a tea party before starting with the project details, and invites Leo for bird melodies contribution. Andy agrees to inform Leo about the street tacos and meeting at Caroline's place the next day. Both express enthusiasm about the collaborative spirit of the project.",

They plan to involve Diego in a bird duet performance for the event and invite him to join. Peter informs Leo that he has already spoken with Samantha about bringing chamomile tea to their meeting at the community garden that evening, and Andy might bring a kitten for creative inspiration.\n\nLeo suggests expanding the event into a musical affair and involving Noor's students in a jam session with music blending with Peter's street tacos and Leo's bird duets. They agree to meet at the park bright and early tomorrow at 10:00 AM. Both parties look forward to creating something magical together.",
