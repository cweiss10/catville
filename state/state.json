And I've got some tacos waiting for us after. By the way, there's a collaborative session happening over chamomile lattes later at Caroline's cafe. Mei's joining Diego and Noor to discuss Andy's cat mural and zines too.\n\nPeter: Sounds like you've got quite the gathering! I spoke with Noor about incorporating city sounds into the project, and she seemed on board. Maybe we can work together to make this a reality?\n\nLeo: Absolutely, Peter. Your ideas could bring a whole new layer to our mechanical birds. Let's catch up after your meeting with Noor and see how things unfold. Maybe even grab some tacos before the session at Caroline's?\n\nPeter: I like that idea, Leo. It feels like this collaboration is shaping up to be something special. See you soon!\n\nLeo: Looking forward to it, Peter. Let's make this project something magical!",
