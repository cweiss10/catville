I was just thinking about our collaboration and the bird melodies for the mural design. How about you join us for street tacos after we finish?\n\nSamantha: That would be lovely. Let's discuss Diego's automation skills regarding watering systems for the strays. I left some notes at the library for him, if he hasn't seen them yet.\n\nCaroline: Speaking of which, I spoke with Diego about it earlier – he seems interested! Maybe we can have a meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow at 3 PM? And I'll bring chamomile tea as promised.\n\nSamantha: Perfect! I'll make sure to bring my noise-cancelling headphones for focus. See you then, Caroline.\n\nCaroline: Looking forward to it, Samantha. Let's make something magical together in our community garden setting!",
