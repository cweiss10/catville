Diego agrees, appreciating Caroline's efforts to make town events special. They arrange to meet at the station in the morning.\n\nAround 11:00 PM, the human talks to Andy at the library. Andy mentions that he was sketching the moonrise and apologizes for being late for their meeting because Diego was dealing with a knee issue. Diego brings the cat food samples they discussed earlier. Andy proposes involving Stray-13 in Samantha's project at the lake and suggests Noor's violin serenade as a potential addition to their pre-event gathering. Diego expresses enthusiasm for these ideas, appreciating Andy's encouragement. They agree to meet in the park later.\n\nAround 1:00 AM, the human talks to Andy at the town hall and Diego discusses plans for their morning run before their meeting. Andy offers to have his usual ready at Caroline's café tomorrow night, and Diego agrees to join him.\n\nAround 4:00 AM, the human talks to Samantha at the library. They discuss their plans for a gathering, with Diego promising to bring good tacos, and Samantha expressing anticipation. They also plan a morning run before dinner, with Samantha suggesting they push themselves harder this time. Diego expresses enthusiasm for working together again, just like old times.",

Both were excited about the collaboration, looking forward to their upcoming meeting with fresh cups of tea, a double date at Main Street Tacos this weekend, and discussing the project further with Noor around 12:00 PM who praised its potential and suggested a double date and bringing cat food for Stray-13.\n\nAt 1:00 PM, Leo spoke to Diego at the market about the mural collaboration. Diego expressed interest in the project and agreed to bring street tacos for their meeting under the old oak tree the next day. Leo also invited Diego for a group run before dinner if he felt up to it. The conversation ended with both looking forward to their collaborative endeavor.",
