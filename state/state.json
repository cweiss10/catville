They plan on having tacos together, sharing seeds for their community garden, and bringing treats for neighborhood cats during their meetings to inspire more murals around town. Diego suggests incorporating squirrel latte art and yoga movements from Samantha into the mural design.\n\nIn a new conversation, Noor receives a call from Diego at home around 12:00 PM. They discuss Noor's collaboration with Peter on the mural project, and Diego expresses excitement about joining in. Noor invites him to meet at Andy's after school tomorrow to further discuss details. Diego suggests having some tacos from Main Street afterward and planning a quick workout with Noor's students before their meeting. Noor agrees, thanks Diego for the heads up about Caroline's latte art involvement, and looks forward to what they will create together.",
