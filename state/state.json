Leo also suggested involving Kitty in the zine club meeting. Andy provided chamomile lattes for Diego and himself tonight at the theater and discussed collaborating on the cat mural project during their pre-meeting tea party at the library tomorrow.\n\nMei is bringing some chamomile from the café for their gathering under the old oak tree this afternoon, and they plan to join Samantha there after their lunch. Noor suggested discussing Samantha's mechanical bird melodies during their meeting. Lastly, Leo, Andy, and Noor agreed to make sure all these plans come together smoothly and looked forward to seeing everyone soon.",
