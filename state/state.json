Mei mentioned Noor's choir joining them for an impromptu duet.\n\nAt around 3:00 AM, Andy spoke with Diego at the theater. The conversation revolved around Andy's mint tea which Diego appreciated as a creative boost. They also discussed collaborating on the cat mural project and the robotics club idea with Noor. Diego brought seedlings for Caroline's garden and suggested grabbing chamomile lattes to make a night of it, emphasizing the importance of community coming together.

And let's talk about those kinetic plant sculptures too. I'll see you there with mint tea in hand.\n\nPeter smiles, feeling a sense of excitement for their collaboration ahead.\n\nLeo: Hey Caroline, the cozy cafe still got that seat with a view of the oak tree, right?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely, Leo! I saved it just for you and our city sounds project. See you under the old oak later!",
