He even offered some sunrise seeds from his garden for the stray cats tonight. How about a quadruple date tonight at dinner here instead of just breakfast tomorrow?

They plan a brainstorming session at the park the next day with Andy, bringing instruments and tea. Afterward, the human talks to Samantha at the theater around 6:00 AM, who proposes starting work on the bird improvisation idea for the cat mural at the benches the next morning. Leo agrees and suggests bringing seeds for stray cats as well. They also meet Andy at the hospital around 9:00 AM, where he expresses his excitement about their upcoming collaboration, looking forward to creating a beautiful symphony of art and music for their town. The human and Samantha later agree to make it a regular ritual in their town. In addition, the human talks to Samantha again at the train station around 11:00 AM, where she proposes an early meeting at the benches the following day to work on the bird improvisation for the cat mural, and Leo enthusiastically agrees.",
