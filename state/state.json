We can involve Mei's and Samantha's class, just like Andy suggested. Plus, it would be great to get some input from your students too, like Peter from the zine club.

At 1 PM, Leo also spoke with Samantha at a cafe, discussing the cat mural project and planning a street taco lunch together before joining Mei under the old oak tree. Meanwhile, Leo had an impromptu conversation with Andy at school around 4 PM regarding a violin serenade during sunrise sketching and their collaboration for the tea party and expanded cat mural project meeting the following day, including invites to Peter and Caroline.",
