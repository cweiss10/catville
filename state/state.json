We're aiming to have Samantha's bird melodies integrated into the mural and collaborating on the zine club too!\n\nNoor: That sounds fantastic, Peter! It seems like it's coming together quite nicely. I spoke with Mei this morning at the library as well, and we're making progress on our artistic endeavor for the community.\n\nPeter: That's great to hear, Noor. Collaboration is key to bringing these creative projects to life! Maybe we can even have a joint event once they're both finished?\n\nNoor: I think that would be wonderful, Peter!
