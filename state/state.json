In the evening, Caroline talks to Noor at the hospital and invites her for a pot of chai with an extra dash of cardamom. They discuss their work on the mechanical birds for the city sounds project, and plan to practice later with Samantha and Leo before taco night. Later that day, Caroline and Noor make plans to practice together the following day after school at Caroline's cafe, focusing on the cat mural project and musical number.\n\nWhile at the park around 2:00 AM, Caroline talks to Mei about borrowing some of her chamomile for tea, discussing their future collaboration on the mural project, inviting Noor and Samantha, and planning to meet the following evening at the old oak tree. Mei agrees, reminding Caroline to save some seeds for the garden.",
