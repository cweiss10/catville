They agreed to meet under the oak tree at Caroline's Cafe tomorrow morning, with Leo bringing headphones and chamomile tea, while Diego promised a new spicy taco recipe.\n\nIn an 8:00 PM conversation at the town hall, Samantha appreciated Leo's improvisations with birds for their shared project at Caroline's Cafe. They agreed to make their 'musical and artistic feast' memorable by incorporating their busking duets and practicing early one morning with headphones.
