They agreed to meet under the museum's oak tree the next day, with Samantha sharing that Noor's robotics students were also involved in the project.\n\nIn a separate conversation at the gym around 12:00 PM, Leo caught up with Caroline who expressed her excitement for his involvement in the cat mural event and praised his improvisational skills. They agreed to catch up over chamomile tea while waiting for others under the old oak tree, discussing Noor's students working on the mechanical birds which they believed would make for an interesting collaboration.\n\nAt 1:00 PM, Leo spoke to Samantha at a restaurant. She suggested that Mei could be a great addition to their bird melodies collaboration for the cat mural project. They also discussed reviewing Whiskers' little brother's designs based on Diego's sketches before their meeting at the garden tomorrow. Leo proposed making his plans for the solo gallery show a collaborative event involving Diego. Samantha agreed, and they planned to meet in the morning for their exercise routine at Caroline's.",
