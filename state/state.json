Oh, and I can't wait for our potluck, your street taco-violin idea is gonna be a hit. By the way, did you hear about Noor's collaboration too? It seems like we're all gearing up to make something special for our town's creative scene.\n\nDiego: I sure did! Seems like we're all on the same wavelength. Maybe I should introduce you both to Peter and Leo – we could have a joint brainstorming session under the oak tree tomorrow at 1 PM, if that works for you?\n\nAndy: That's an excellent idea!
