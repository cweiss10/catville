Peter will contribute his robotics ideas, and stray cats are suggested to be included as well. The group decides to make it a potluck and plans to include a chamomile latte session for discussing the robotics elements. Andy is excited about the upcoming gathering filled with creativity and community spirit.\n\nIn separate conversations, Andy talks to Leo about incorporating Leo's mechanical bird design into the cat mural project, with Noor suggesting meeting under the old oak tree at 3 PM instead of tonight. They also discuss incorporating chamomile tea, with Leo promising to bring some for both the cats and their chamomile lattes during the gathering.\n\nLater on, Andy talks to Caroline around 11:00 AM at her cafe, where he shows off his latest sunrise sketch. Caroline offers him a free taster of her new latte art and discusses potential collaboration ideas for the cat mural project, suggesting they have lunch together next week to further discuss.",
