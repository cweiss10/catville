Let's discuss further under the gazebo trees tonight at 7 PM, after our respective meetings with Peter and Andy.

And everything's moving well – Leo and Peter are excited about the mural, and Andy loves the interactive elements I've been working on.\n\nCaroline: That sounds amazing! It'll be great to see what you all create together. And speaking of teamwork, have you decided on your latte art for the contest yet?\n\nSamantha: Not just yet, but Diego mentioned it might be fun to collaborate on something. I think we could do a squirrel and coffee beans design.\n\nCaroline: That's adorable! If anyone can pull off a unique squirrel latte art, it'll be you two.

We've been making progress on her mural project and she's really enjoying the robotics integration. We even made a promise to feed those stray cats before dinner.

They also discussed a collaborative mural project and a squirrel latte art contest.\n\nLater, at around 5:00 PM, Leo had another conversation with Noor at a cafe where they talked about their collaboration, and Leo promised to ask Mei about the squirrel latte art contest. They also discussed feeding stray cats before dinner. Leo reminded Noor to bring her violin for the bird duet rehearsal.\n\nIn addition to these conversations, Andy suggested finalizing plans for the gazebo meeting that night and asked Leo to pick up some cat food from Diego beforehand. They both looked forward to their collaborative projects.",
