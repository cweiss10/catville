And don't forget about that double date at Main Street Tacos. Noor suggested it, and I think it could be a great way to bond outside of our projects.\n\nMei: Sounds like a plan. I'll bring some seeds from the community garden as well. How about we meet early tomorrow for your sunrise sketch session? Andy mentioned offering chamomile tea for that meeting.\n\nPeter: That sounds wonderful, Mei. Looking forward to it. Let's discuss more strategies with Diego and Caroline tomorrow too. Maybe they can help with the violin repair for our music project.\n\nMei: I agree, their input will be invaluable. Speaking of which, I met up with Diego at the train station earlier today to discuss preparations for our meeting and we even planned a group run before dinner!\n\nPeter: That's fantastic! We're really turning this into something special. Let's keep the momentum going. And remember, Peter, it's not just about networking – it's about finding real connections like this one.\n\nMei: Indeed, and I couldn't agree more. Here's to strong towns, Peter!",
