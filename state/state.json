Later in the day, around 8:00 PM, Mei talks to Noor at the library who expresses interest in joining forces to incorporate music into the community event. Since Leo had also mentioned similar ideas, they consider his potential contribution to the mural design as well.\n\nMei later approaches Diego at town_hall, inviting him to collaborate on the cat mural project and a planned community workout event. Diego agrees to help out, suggesting they discuss further over tacos at Main Street later in the week. They plan to meet on Wednesday after their gym session. In addition to this, Mei also has a conversation with Caroline at the theater around 10:00 PM, but details about this conversation are not provided in the lines of conversation given.

Noor agreed to meet up tomorrow for their run and finalize everything over tacos. They also discussed the need for amps for Main Street Tacos to avoid technical hiccups on event day.

They decided to meet up at the park the next day for bird duet practice and finalize details for the amps needed for Main Street Tacos during their event.\n\nLater, Noor spoke with Caroline at the hospital, who suggested making the event a bigger collaboration involving everyone, possibly even Mei's students performing some music. Noor discussed the squirrel latte art for El Charro's performance with Andy and proposed blending it with Caroline's cat designs and some bird duets from their yoga sessions. They agreed to plan everything out at Main Street Tacos on Thursday.",
