Peter informs Leo that his amp repair is nearly complete and encourages him to show it off during their meeting. Diego and Peter suggest involving Leo's students in their music session at Main Street Tacos, which he agrees to.\n\nLater, the human talks to Samantha at school around 11:00 PM. They discuss collaborating on the cat-themed project, incorporating routine logic puzzles and arranging them around a mural for park visitors. They agree to involve kids from the community center and add Leo's bird duets.\n\nDuring a conversation with Caroline at the gym around 10:00 AM, Leo suggests a feline-friendly performance for their cat-themed project, with Caroline potentially joining in. Caroline mentions Mei inviting her for tacos today and mentions Andy's mural collaboration involving Caroline. Leo proposes a quadruple date in the park, which sounds fun to him.
