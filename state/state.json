We should also discuss having chamomile tea for the strays at our pre-event gathering under the old oak tree. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That sounds wonderful, Andy. I was thinking about bringing some snacks for the students too. And I'd be more than happy to serenade everyone with my violin before we head to your place for oolong tea.

Noor also proposed this collaboration, suggesting that Leo performs with her and they should incorporate Leo's rhythm-based algorithm into their project. They also discussed trying chamomile tea under the old oak tree for the stray cats and planned a double date with Samantha and Peter.\n\nDuring their conversation at town hall around 2:00 AM, Caroline inquired about Leo's meeting with Andy. Leo shared that it was productive, discussing intriguing ideas for the mural project. They also talked about Noor's cat mural collaboration with the sunrise symphony, and Caroline mentioned that she had been moonlighting as an indie singer at the theater. She invited Leo to join her for a duet sometime, which he accepted, expressing admiration for Caroline's ability to connect people and keep the cafe's cozy vibe.\n\nOn 6:00 AM the next day, Leo talked to Andy at school about his recovery from a minor setback. They confirmed their meeting under the old oak tree, discussed Andy's sketch that could inspire the mural and musical collaboration, and Andy promised to bring fresh cat food for Stray-13. They also planned to incorporate chamomile tea during the symphony event for the stray cats and looked forward to a memorable day with their collaborative work.",
