She also proposes involving Noor in the project and adding some violin touches to their artwork. Andy asks about incorporating yoga elements as she suggested and if Caroline has heard from Leo about him joining the project.\n\nCaroline hasn't heard from Leo but mentions that Peter mentioned he expressed interest and recommended a meeting this Thursday for street tacos.

How about we make it a double date with Diego too?\n\nAndy: That's perfect! I think he would enjoy that. Let's exchange some seeds while we're there, for the community garden.
