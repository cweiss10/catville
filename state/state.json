If it helps with our work here or my training, I'd be happy to take a look. And maybe we can catch up more about it during our run tomorrow.\n\nDiego (smiling): By the way, did you hear about Leo's idea for incorporating melodies into the mural? He's quite the musician. Maybe we could collaborate on something unique!\n\nSamantha: I heard, and it sounds lovely! It might be just the right touch to bring the mural to life.

At around 2:00 AM, at a train station, Caroline proposes involving Leo's music in the cat mural project, and they decide to meet Andy at a café the next day to discuss details over chamomile tea for the stray cats. Excited by the prospect of incorporating music into the project, Leo suggests improvising tunes for the mural and plans a duet under the old oak tree with Caroline. Additionally, they talk about their double date with Samantha and Andy under the old oak tree, aiming to make it an unforgettable night.
