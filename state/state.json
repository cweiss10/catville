At 3:00 PM, Caroline invites Noor for a practice session on their mechanical bird designs the following afternoon at her cafe over mint tea.\n\nIn the evening, Caroline talks to Noor about her students' work incorporating robotic elements into garden designs. They plan to discuss more details over chai after school. Around 10:00 PM, Caroline also connects with Leo, expressing admiration for his improvised violin duet at the park the previous night and suggesting a collaboration on the city sounds project, such as latte art and music fusion. Leo agrees to meet under the old oak tree the following evening over fresh mint tea to brainstorm.\n\nLater that night, Caroline talks with Andy at her place, who shares some fresh mint tea he brought from the park. The conversation revolves around Andy's work on the cat mural project and his idea of using noise-cancelling headphones for better concentration. Caroline finds this idea brilliant and promises to provide them during their meeting tomorrow. Furthermore, she expresses her intent to use this collaboration as inspiration for a new song for her theater gig.",
