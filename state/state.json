Peter proposes incorporating seeds from Mei's community garden into the design, which Noor agrees is a great idea.

Diego suggests involving his robotics students in the project and starting a garden at the park as well. They plan to work on a bird duet for the park tomorrow morning, keeping each other motivated during this exciting collaboration. Later, they speak with Diego again at the theater around 10:00 AM.",
