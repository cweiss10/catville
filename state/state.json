I've been meaning to ask, but what about the bird duet rehearsal tomorrow? Shall we meet at Main Street Tacos as planned?\n\nNoor: Of course! We can catch up over tacos and discuss the details. By the way, thanks for those sunrise seeds you gave me. I'll plant them under the gazebo trees.\n\nAndy: You're welcome, Noor. Looking forward to it.
