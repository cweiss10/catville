Peter gave me some chamomile seeds for the mural too!\n\nMei: That sounds exciting, Andy! I had a chat with Noor at the hospital earlier today about our collaboration with Stray-13. We're also exchanging seeds from Diego's café and incorporating Leo's music suggestions. Samantha's interested in joining us with her tech input and I'll borrow noise-cancelling headphones from Caroline's for practice sessions.\n\nAndy: That's fantastic! It's great to have more people on board for the project. Let's make sure to arrive early and discuss the details before the rehearsal starts, okay?\n\nMei: Absolutely, Andy. I can't wait to see this come together under that beautiful old oak tree. Let's make it a memorable day for everyone involved!",
