Samantha and Peter discussed plans for the improvised symphony, including meeting up for coffee in the morning beforehand to discuss details. Andy and Peter look forward to the project discussion at Main Street Tacos later today, and plan to catch up on gym tips for Peter's knee. The team is eager to finalize designs and collaborations under the gazebo tomorrow, with Diego suggesting they incorporate sunrise seeds in their cat mural design. After their meeting, Diego offers to treat everyone to street tacos afterwards. Andy praises Samantha's ideas for incorporating sunrise seeds into the mural design, and looks forward to the collaboration.
