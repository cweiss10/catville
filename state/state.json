With Andy, they discussed the squirrel latte contest as a potential fun addition to their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos. Leo then spoke to Diego at the market around 8:00 AM, where they agreed to collaborate on the cat mural project under the gazebo, incorporating violin music, improvisational sessions with birds, and inviting Noor and Andy to join them. They also remembered the squirrel latte contest as a potential fun addition to their quadruple date at Main Street Tacos.\n\nAt 2:00 PM, Leo had another conversation with Diego at the library, where Diego expressed interest in the squirrel latte contest and offered to show off his amazing latte designs for the cat mural project. They also made plans to feed stray cats under the gazebo trees before starting the project. Diego shared new street taco recipes and expressed excitement about their duet under the gazebo trees, with Leo looking forward to their meeting at 3 PM sharp.",
