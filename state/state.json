They planned to meet at street tacos for productive brainstorming sessions. During the day, Leo suggested working together on latte art designs for his mural, and Noor's yoga students were also involved in the project.\n\nAround 11:00 PM, Diego encountered Leo at the train station and they discussed the potential collaboration on music for the event. At midnight, Diego talked to Samantha at the museum who shared updates on the cat-inspired poses for the mural, suggesting involving Noor's students and perhaps Leo as well. Both Diego and Samantha agreed to meet up after their separate meetings tomorrow at Main Street Tacos to finalize everything together.\n\nAround 2:00 AM, Diego talked to Peter at a restaurant where he inquired about his knee injury and discussed the cat mural project. Peter expressed excitement about the project, especially with Noor and Mei involved. They also discussed the need for certain seeds for the project, which Diego promised to bring tomorrow during their quadruple date in the park.\n\nAt 4:00 AM, Diego spoke with Noor at the market, where they further planned the cat mural details. Noor suggested integrating yoga elements and bringing sketchbooks to discuss them the next day. They also discussed the need for snacks for Noor's students and agreed to meet at Caroline's Café the following day. Later, at 6:00 AM, Diego conversed with Noor again at the train station, where they discussed arranging amps for Main Street Tacos before parting ways.\n\nLater in the day, around 9:00 AM, Diego communicated with Noor about their collaboration. He mentioned that Caroline and he had discussed integrating Noor's robotics club and Leo's bird improvisations into the cat-themed event. They agreed to meet for street tacos and a run tomorrow, with Mei and Leo joining as well. Noor expressed her excitement about the collaboration and suggested discussing the cat mural project over tacos. Diego promised to bring the seeds he had mentioned earlier for their quadruple date in the park. Both agreed to meet at Caroline's Café later that day.\n\nAround 8:00 AM on another day, Peter proposed involving Diego's fitness expertise for a yoga session during the cat event. Diego accepted and suggested timing it right after El Charro's performance, followed by a taco feast. Peter also suggested inviting his bird duet for the yoga session and coordinating it with their quadruple date in the park. Diego agreed to this plan and mentioned a taco date with Mei next week.",

We think they'll be perfect for the cat mural event! By the way, Diego recommended Main Street Tacos – have you tried them yet?\n\nPeter: Nope, not yet! Sounds like a plan then. Let's meet there tomorrow after our morning run and finalize all details together. Oh, and I suggested involving Samantha's zine club kids in the project – what do you think?\n\nNoor: That's a great idea! Leo's already on board with it too. We can discuss more about the yoga sessions after that. See you tomorrow at Main Street Tacos!",

I was just discussing this with Peter last night. Let's set up that collaborative brainstorming session soon. Main Street Tacos on Thursday?\n\nCaroline: Absolutely!
