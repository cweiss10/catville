They also talk further about details such as inviting Noor's robotics club to provide food for stray cats during their community event.\n\nIn the afternoon, Andy talks to Noor at the train station around 1:00 PM. Noor suggests collaborating with Diego on latte art and chamomile tea for their gathering under the old oak tree. They agree to feed Stray-13 beforehand and confirm the meeting at Caroline's Café tomorrow at 6 PM. Noor also mentions bringing Luna from the library to join them in the project.\n\nLater that night, Andy talks to Samantha at the hospital around 2:00 AM. They discuss Leo's involvement with his violin skills for a duet with mechanical birds in the mural project.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, Andy talks to Caroline at the train station around 4:00 AM. Andy suggests having a taco party during the planning meeting at Caroline's Cafe and invites everyone involved in the mural project, including Noor's robotics club members. Caroline agrees to the plan, suggesting careful consideration for Stray-13's sensitive stomach when serving tacos.",

Noor agrees and also invites Diego to join her, Mei, Samantha, and Leo under the old oak tree next weekend to share updates about their projects. Diego accepts and looks forward to a memorable collaboration.",

At 3:00 AM, he talked to Samantha at the museum about his improvised violin duet at the park and her technology-inspired cat mural ideas, which included incorporating logic puzzles and Noor's robotics club joining their team. They agreed to discuss a collaboration between Samantha's cats and Leo's mechanical birds at the gym the next day.\n\nAt around 4:00 AM, Leo talked to Peter at the theater about the robotics angle for their mural. He shared that he and Diego were brainstorming rhythm ideas for Stray-13, planning to discuss more the following day with Caroline. Peter was excited about this and expressed interest in hearing Leo's violin practice, which Leo agreed to share during their break from discussing work.\n\nAt 9:00 AM, Leo talked to Caroline at the hospital. She showcased her latte art and discussed syncing up with Mei and Diego. Caroline also asked about mechanical birds for their cat mural, to which Leo had some ideas he was sketching out. They agreed to meet later that day.",
