Later in the day, Caroline had conversations with both Leo (at around 7:00 PM at the hospital) and Leo (at around 9:00 PM at the theater).\n\nAt the hospital, they discussed incorporating hazelnut and cinnamon into the squirrel latte contest. Leo also invited his feathered friends for their duet performance. Caroline invited Leo to a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos the following day, which he agreed to, mentioning that he would bring his violin to add magic to their cat mural event under the gazebo.\n\nAt the theater, they discussed Caroline's usual swan latte with extra honey, along with a duet at the gazebo the next morning before sunrise. However, Caroline had to meet Peter first about some projects and the cat mural event this weekend. Leo expressed enthusiasm for the squirrel latte contest and praised Caroline's collaborations as being thanks to people like him.\n\nIn the evening, Caroline talked to Andy at the park around 11:00 PM. They discussed plans for a collaboration with Mei on music for their gazebo gathering, and Peter suggested they catch up before feeding stray cats together under the gazebo that night. Caroline mentioned her quadruple date plan with Leo, Samantha, and possibly Noor to Andy. He agreed, suggesting they invite everyone together.\n\nLater in the night, Caroline talked to Diego at the hospital around 12:00 AM. She gave him sunrise seeds for the stray cats and discussed coordinating their efforts better with Samantha regarding unique patterns for the mural. They looked forward to a busy day ahead and making this project special for everyone involved.",
