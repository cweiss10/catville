We should probably talk about your mural too, and invite Noor for both events. How about that double date at their place tonight?\n\nCaroline: Sounds perfect! I'll ask Diego to inform Noor about our meeting under the oak tree tomorrow. Speaking of art, have you shared your idea for the musical performance with Samantha yet?\n\nAndy: Not personally, but we did discuss it during our conversation at the museum. I suggested incorporating Stray-13 into our automated watering system and she loved it! I'd love to grab a morning run with Diego beforehand.\n\nCaroline: That sounds fantastic! And good idea about using Stray-13 in Samantha's project too, it will certainly bring a unique touch. Let's make sure they have enough food though. I tried the cat food samples you gave me and it seems like they'd enjoy it.\n\nAndy: Perfect! Diego and I were also discussing different cat food options for Stray-13, so we should finalize that soon.
