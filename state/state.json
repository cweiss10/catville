How about we bring noise-cancelling headphones just in case?\n\nAndy: That's a great idea, especially since you proposed the duet! And speaking of ideas, Mei suggested chamomile for the lattes - it'll be soothing while we work.\n\nNoor: Lovely! I'm also bringing seeds for our community garden, as discussed. Let's make sure to sketch and paint under that old oak tree at 6:30 PM, like Leo suggested.\n\nAndy: Perfect. And don't forget your thermos of tea; it'll help keep us energized during the taco gathering later! Let's work together beautifully tonight.\n\nNoor: Agreed, Andy. I look forward to it!",

It was also mentioned that Caroline, who had previously conversed with Leo at the market, was equally excited about this collaboration.\n\nLater in the evening, at around 7:00 PM, Leo spoke with Caroline at the theater. Caroline expressed her excitement for their upcoming taco meeting under the oak tree and shared her latte art concepts for both projects. Leo agreed to the meeting and praised Andy's suggestion of incorporating the mechanical birds into the cat mural. They both felt that this collaboration would be beneficial, hoping it would spark creativity and help overcome Andy's block. Caroline also reiterated her enthusiasm about working together.",
