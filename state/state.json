Peter suggested collaborating with Caroline on the yoga session for the zine club next month.\n\nLeo mentioned his discussions about music with Andy for the coffee gallery project and proposed meeting up this weekend to further discuss ideas. Peter suggested making it a double date, inviting Caroline and Diego. Leo also shared updates about a potential project at the theater with Caroline, which he discussed with Noor at school.\n\nPeter then proposed using Leo's improvisations as background ambiance in his new gym, to which Leo agreed. Both looked forward to making the most out of their collaborative efforts and meeting up this weekend to share updates.",
