Around 3 PM, Andy proposes dinner with Samantha that same evening at an Italian place to further discuss their collaboration and mural project details. Samantha agrees and expresses excitement about their collaborations. Andy also mentions Caroline's idea of incorporating a logic puzzle into the mural, which Samantha is willing to help create as long as it complements the theme and adds an engaging element for viewers. Later in the day at 5 PM, Andy talks to Diego at school about their double date and ideas for the mural project. Diego suggests incorporating fitness elements and offers to help design a safe and comfortable space for stray cats hidden within the gallery show, making it even more unique. Both look forward to their collaborations and the upcoming double date.",
