They decide to invite everyone, including Leo, for street tacos at Caroline's place beforehand.\n\nDuring the following day, Caroline talks to Diego at the hospital. She informs him about the progress of the discussions with Mei and Andy. They plan to meet the next day at Caroline's place to finalize designs and discuss mechanical bird duets, with the communal tea party under the old oak tree still in the works. Diego agrees to attend the meeting and the event under the oak tree.\n\nCaroline talks to Noor at a museum around 2:00 PM. She proposes that Noor's students create mechanical birds inspired by Leo's improvisations for the mural project. Noor agrees, suggesting a joint jam session at the park to finalize details and inviting Mei and her zine club as well. Caroline suggests having a chamomile latte before their brainstorming session at the community garden that night. Noor brings extra snacks for the students and chai lattes too, looking forward to their collaboration.",

They decide to finalize the details tomorrow at the community garden, and consider adding a live kitten for creative inspiration.\n\nAt around 4:00 AM, Leo talks to Andy at the town hall where Andy appreciciates Leo's improvisational music with the birds from their morning performance at the park. They discuss the possibility of Andy incorporating sound into his artwork and the need for Leo's violin skills. Andy agrees to bring tea in a thermos to the potluck, and they look forward to their creative evening under the stars. Leo encourages Andy about the prospect of a solo gallery show.\n\nAround 12:00 PM, Leo talks to Andy at the town hall again, where Andy suggests meeting early tomorrow at the park to work on mechanical bird designs for the cat mural project together. Andy is excited to expand the event into a musical affair and involve everyone in a true collaboration. They look forward to what tomorrow brings.",
