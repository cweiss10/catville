Tonight at 7:00 PM, they will meet at the library to finalize city sounds for the mechanical birds project, with Andy, Leo, and Diego attending, and grabbing chamomile lattes beforehand as provided by Caroline.\n\nAfterward, they plan to enjoy Caroline's street tacos. In a conversation with Samantha at the market around 10:00 PM, it was suggested that Leo could contribute his melodies to the mechanical bird project, and both women agreed to meet under the old oak tree this weekend to discuss further, bringing their pets along. Peter was also invited to join them due to his latte art skills and potential contributions to the bird design and melodies.\n\nIn a conversation with Samantha at the theater around 12:00 AM, it was decided that they would bounce ideas off Peter during their discussion of the mechanical birds project at the library. They also discussed having a meeting at the hospital, which Caroline found exciting. Both women look forward to their collaborative projects and exchanging ideas.\n\nLater in a conversation with Leo at theater around 1:00 AM, it was confirmed that he has composed bird melodies for the mural project and plans to discuss them with the group during the tea party under the old oak tree this weekend. He also mentioned that Andy is excited about collaborating and will have sketches ready for their meeting tomorrow. The group looks forward to further discussions and collaborations.",
