How about we make it a planning meeting and invite Peter as well? And maybe we can discuss the squirrel latte art contest idea with Samantha there?\n\nDiego: Love that idea! Let's do it. And don't forget, I still owe you those headphones from Caroline's café. See you tomorrow at 10:00 AM!\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect! I'll bring sunrise seeds for the gazebo trees too.

They also discussed collaborating with Diego's robotics club to add squirrel latte art for extra flair. They planned to catch up at Main Street Tacos the next day at 11:30 AM to discuss further plans, and Leo mentioned that he had already talked to Samantha about using her coding skills for their robotics elements.
