By the way, Diego is also joining in with some museum ideas. We might have dinner together before the brainstorming session next week?\n\nNoor: That would be great, let's make it a double date with Peter and Mei at that new taco spot you mentioned. Also, I've got a dinner with Samantha on Tuesday to discuss more project details. Leo's robotics club is joining us too!\n\nCaroline: Wonderful! Looking forward to our double date this weekend and the improvisation session at the park today if you can make it?\n\nNoor: I might be busy tending to my strays behind the cafe tonight, but let's catch up more at the cafe this weekend for sure.
