On Saturday morning, they decided to have a library planning session and possibly start with a yoga session at the park. Later, Caroline spoke to Peter at her café and suggested a joint meeting for the mural project discussions at the community garden, also inviting Leo.\n\nOn the following morning, around 8:00 AM at the train station, Caroline talked to Samantha about their coordinated efforts for the community event. Samantha agreed to coordinate their efforts at El Charro and include a duet by Leo in the mural project discussion at the library the next day.",

We can discuss more details during our coffee meeting later today, right?\n\nAndy: Absolutely! I was also thinking about having a little team-building event at Caroline's Café, where the kids from your club and Mei's group could help out with stray cat assistance. What do you think?\n\nNoor: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Andy! It would not only be beneficial for the cats but also bring our groups closer together. I'll make sure to talk about it with my students and let you know their availability. See you at the park this afternoon for our pre-session discussion, right?\n\nAndy: You got it!

Later in the day, around 1:00 PM, Leo talks to Samantha at a cafe where she expresses her admiration for his bird-playing skills.
