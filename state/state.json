They exchanged compliments on each other's talents, with Andy asking about gathering chamomile tea bags for their cat project. Caroline confirmed she had them and also discussed setting up a meeting with Noor to discuss their stray cat tea station idea. Andy suggested meeting at the park during Caroline's sunrise sketch session the following day to share thoughts on symphony rehearsals, and Caroline agreed to bring fresh coffee.",
