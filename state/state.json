I met Leo and discussed a duet of violin and sunrise sketches. We're planning to meet there tonight at 6 PM, followed by our morning run tomorrow.\n\nCaroline: That sounds amazing! I talked to Diego about it this morning, and he timed his run under the oak tree as well. He mentioned Noor will be joining us soon.

Let's make sure those kitties are taken care of!\n\nAndy: Agreed. I'll see you at the gazebo tonight then, looking forward to it!\n\nCaroline: Sounds perfect.

Leo plans to further discuss this collaboration under the old oak tree that evening before running together as usual. They decide to grab some coffee at Main Street Tacos before their meeting with Andy, who shares his new sketch for the cat mural and suggests a duet with Caroline during their musical collaboration.
