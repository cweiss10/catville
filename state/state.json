She shared her ideas for the cat mural project, incorporating robotics elements and inviting Diego with his tacos and his kitten. They decided to make it a potluck and discussed turning it into their own little creative haven (previously summarized). Andy appreciated Mei's enthusiasm and unique ideas, looking forward to more collaborations (previously summarized).\n\nAt 4:00 AM, Mei spoke to Peter at the town hall about incorporating robotics for mechanical birds in their project. They decided to discuss further under the old oak tree after lunch and plan to make it a memorable event (previously summarized). Peter also invited Mei to work out together sometime (previously summarized).\n\nMei reminded Peter about chamomile seeds for Samantha's garden, to which Peter agreed. Peter appreciated Mei's ideas and looked forward to their collaboration (previously summarized).\n\nAt 6:00 AM, Mei spoke to Samantha at the library. She suggested Diego's sketches for the mechanical birds in the cat mural project, and they agreed it would be a great addition. Samantha promised to bring Diego and some stray cats to the meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow (new conversation). They both looked forward to creating something special together (new conversation).\n\nAt 7:00 AM, Mei talked to Leo at a cafe about the progress of the cat mural project. He expressed excitement about incorporating his mechanical birds and mentioned Noor's idea of inviting stray cats to their meetings as a small town ritual. Leo appreciated Mei's organization and her role in bringing the community together (new conversation).",
