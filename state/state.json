Caroline shared her excitement about Leo's performance under the old oak tree and Diego's bird melodies. Samantha suggested they bring tacos for energy during their session.\n\nCaroline informed Samantha that she had not yet heard from Diego about his violin melodies but spoke with him earlier in the day.

Peter is excited about playing his violin during their town's symphony project, an idea suggested by Caroline. They agree to meet at Caroline's to discuss details and plan ahead. Diego suggests including chamomile tea for Stray-13 and her friends as a perfect touch for the collaboration.
