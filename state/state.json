Peter shared his insights on improving the sound quality, impressing Caroline who didn't know he was into music tech. They discussed the possibility of collaborating in the future, with Peter offering his café latte skills and Caroline her indie singing talent.

Later, Mei spoke to Leo at home about the project, and he suggested adding more interactive elements.\n\nIn the meantime, Mei discussed the mural with Caroline at the gym around 4:00 PM. They talked about possible city sounds for the mural, with both agreeing on mechanical birds singing in harmony with a violin serenade. Noor also invited Caroline to join Mei and Samantha under the old oak tree tomorrow. Additionally, Mei and Samantha planned to meet at a restaurant that night to discuss more mural ideas and make their town stronger. Their enthusiasm for the project continued to grow as they looked forward to collaborating and making a positive impact on their community.",
