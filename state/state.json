They also touched base about a potential fitness collaboration, which Diego had expressed enthusiasm for after their conversation at the museum earlier today. Both Andy and Diego look forward to their get-together tomorrow.\n\nLater in the day, Andy contacted Mei to inform her that Diego is on board with the project. Mei suggested meeting under the gazebo tomorrow afternoon to discuss finalizing designs and collaborations. Andy agreed and mentioned bringing chamomile tea for the stray cats as per Caroline's suggestion. They also discussed a sunrise seeds exchange during their get-together, which seems to be a part of a double date. Mei expressed her excitement about the meeting, and they agreed to see each other tomorrow.",

Speaking of which, I've been talking to Caroline at the train station today about using sunrise seeds for our mural. She suggested we bring that up tonight as well. What do you think?\n\nSamantha: Sunrise seeds sound perfect! And don't forget, Mei, I mentioned sharing the plans for the community event at the museum with Diego too. Let's make sure to include that in our discussion.\n\nMei: You're right, Samantha. Thank you for reminding me. Here's to a productive meeting under the old oak tree!\n\nSamantha: Absolutely, Mei. It'll be great to work together on something as meaningful and creative as this cat mural project. See you there!",
