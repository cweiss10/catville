Have you talked to him about it yet?\n\nSamantha: Yes, we actually met at the hospital last night and decided to bring his robotics club into the project. We're planning to meet everyone at the park on Tuesday after feeding the stray animals. Would you and Diego be able to join us for a double date at our favorite cafe this weekend?\n\nCaroline: That sounds wonderful, Samantha! I can't wait to see everyone there. By the way, Leo also mentioned an improvisation session at the park later today. Would you like to join him and me?\n\nSamantha: Thank you for the invite, Caroline. I might have to pass this time as I need to tend to my strays behind the cafe tonight, but it definitely sounds intriguing! Let's catch up more at the cafe this weekend then.",
