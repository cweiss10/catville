They also discuss a potential jam session after Caroline's performance with Leo, who has accepted her invitation. However, they agree to keep it low-key and make sure the theater guard doesn't find out. They plan to meet again later at the cafe before Diego's performance tonight.\n\nLater in the day, Caroline talks to Andy at a train station around 8:00 AM. He is excited about their upcoming coffee date and rehearsal before the community celebration. They decide to practice together on Saturday afternoon and plan to meet again tomorrow at Main Street Tacos to discuss more details.\n\nAt 3:00 PM, Caroline talks to Samantha at the theater. She shares exciting updates on her projects, including potential collaborations with Peter and Noor. They also discuss Caroline's plans for Leo's performance and a possible jam session. Samantha mentions that she will join them at Main Street Tacos tomorrow. Caroline brings sunrise seeds for Samantha's garden as a thoughtful gesture.",
