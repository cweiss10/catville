I think that would be fantastic. And how about adding some logic puzzles involving stray cats? It could make it more engaging for the kids. Plus, I was thinking we could collaborate on chamomile lattes as well, since you're an indie singer at the theater and all.\n\nCaroline: Oh, I'd love that! Let's involve Peter with his mechanical birds too, and maybe Leo can help us design some of the puzzles. We should make it official with a potluck under the old oak tree where we first started discussing this. How does that sound to you?\n\nNoor: Sounds perfect to me, Caroline! I'll reach out to everyone and coordinate schedules for the potluck tomorrow at 3 PM. See you there!",

By the way, I shared our plans with Caroline earlier, and she's excited about it all.\n\nLeo: Wonderful! It's great to see everyone getting involved. I can't wait for our community to enjoy this project. Speaking of which, Caroline saved you a seat at the potluck under the oak tree, and she invited me to serenade her latte art creations during the tea party.\n\nPeter: That sounds like a perfect fit!
