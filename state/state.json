Speaking of which, did you manage to convince that new gym member with the knee issue to try yoga?\n\nDiego: I'm still working on him. He's a stubborn one, but I know it'll help his recovery. And on that note, I could use your advice about stretching before painting. I don't want another knee incident while I'm trying to save a victim!\n\nAndy: Haha, you've got it covered, Diego! But remember what we worked on last week? Bend those fingers and wrists, keep the elbows loose. And don't forget about your tea! I'll see you at the gym later.\n\nDiego: Sounds good.

I appreciate the reminder about stretching. I should get back to it once we're done here. By the way, have you thought about hosting your zine club at the community center? It might attract more people that way.\n\nMei: That's a wonderful idea! Let me see if we can arrange that for next month. I'm all for making our town stronger with small rituals like yours and mine.
