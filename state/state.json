We'll make sure to include your robotics club in our meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow at 10 AM. Shall we meet at Caroline's Cafe first, as per usual?\n\nNoor: Perfect plan! I'm looking forward to Diego showing off his new kitten and discussing the mechanical birds integration with Leo. And who knows, maybe we'll even grab some street tacos afterward, if Diego's knee is up for it.\n\nMei: Sounds like a wonderful way to spend the day.
