He has this cool idea for a yoga session at the park involving my squirrel tunes. How about we coordinate with Mei and Diego to make it even more special?\n\nAndy: Absolutely! Let's meet this Thursday after our usual gym sessions. I was thinking we could have dinner with students at Main Street Tacos, and maybe set up a regular feeding schedule for the stray cats behind Caroline's Café too?\n\nNoor: That's perfect, Andy! I also spoke to Peter about our project. He's really excited, and he mentioned your sunrise sketches. Perhaps we could involve his kids as well?\n\nAndy: Of course! It'll be a wonderful team-building event. See you Thursday then!",
