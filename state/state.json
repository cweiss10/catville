They decided to involve Noor's robotics club in their brainstorming session the next day and considered starting a garden at the park using seeds from Mei's community garden. They also discussed bringing the cozy vibe of the cafe to the events.\n\nAround 12:00 AM, Caroline spoke to Andy at the library. They agreed to collaborate on the cat mural project with Andy and Leo, incorporating music by Mei's bird improv and inviting Peter, the zine club members, and stray cats. Andy proposed an impromptu brainstorm under the trees in the park the following morning. Caroline promised to reach out to everyone and coordinate a musical collaboration for the community celebration. The combined talents of all parties involved were expected to make the project extraordinary.",
