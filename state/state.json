They plan to make this an unforgettable evening by incorporating various elements such as music, logic, collaboration between Leo and Samantha, a possible cat-involving mural by Noor, stray cats, and Peter's archiving book under the gazebo trees. Later at around 9:00 PM, Leo meets Diego at the gazebo who suggests discussing their plans and Diego's mentioned sunrise seeds. They also plan to meet first under an old oak tree where Leo will serenade Caroline with music involving those very seeds before moving on to the gazebo for the rest of the event.\n\nAt 11:00 PM, Leo talks to Samantha at a cafe. She shows interest in the sunrise seeds for the cat mural and they discuss it. Leo informs her that he has already discussed it with Peter and they are meeting under an old oak tree that night. They decide to have tea together before rehearsal.",
