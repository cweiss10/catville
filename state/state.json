Noor suggests collaborating with various community groups such as kids, art, science, zine club friends, robotics club kids, and a possible violin performance. Around 2:00 PM, Peter talks to Andy at a cafe, discussing his progress on the mechanical bird project. They discuss inviting Samantha's class for the tea party under the old oak tree and involving other groups such as Mei and her friends who are working on the cat mural.\n\nAround 6:00 PM at the town hall, Peter and Andy decide to expand the tea party event by inviting everyone including Mei and Caroline. They plan to make a day of it at the theater, involving Leo in bringing his sketch for the cat mural and asking him to arrange street tacos for lunch. The event aims to maintain traditional chamomile lattes and include quiet spaces for those who prefer them.\n\nIn further discussions with Leo around 8:00 PM at the park, Peter suggests inviting Leo to the tea party under the old oak tree. Leo agrees and proposes tying in his improvisation skills to make the mechanical birds serenade during the event. They decide to have an impromptu lunch first to collaborate and create memories together. Both Peter and Leo envision it as a community event that brings them all together, strengthening friendships and collaborations.",

Leo also invited Samantha to join them for lunch beforehand. Noor, a school friend of Leo's, was excited about the collaboration and suggested joining Samantha for street tacos beforehand. Later in the day, Mei discussed with Leo the idea of having a mini-zine corner at their community event.\n\nThe anticipation for this collaboration was as exhilarating as one of the quiet park mornings with Leo's violin serenade. The group would also be joined by mechanical bird melodies and Diego's kitten, making it an adorable and creative gathering under the old oak tree.",

It could be a great way to collaborate and create memories together. And Leo, I've been meaning to say this - your improvisation skills are something else.
