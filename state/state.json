They also discuss a bird duet under the gazebo, with Peter planning to discuss it with Caroline. The group also considers Noor's latte art potential for their evening performance.\n\nAndy then talks to Noor at the museum around 3:00 PM, proposing turning their cat mural project into a team bonding activity with stray cats and discussing scientific elements in the design. They plan to meet under the gazebo the next day to discuss further, with Noor bringing snacks for everyone, including stressed-out EMTs like Peter. Andy also suggests feeding the stray cats before their meeting on Sunday as Mei suggested.\n\nIn a subsequent phone call with Samantha, Andy proposes working on a logic puzzle together during their next collaborative session under the gazebo trees. They also plan to feed strays beforehand as they believe it adds a special touch to their meetings. Meanwhile, Andy talks to Caroline at home around 4:00 PM and mentions discussing a bird duet with her under the gazebo, planning for a magical night that could inspire new projects around town. They anticipate music from Leo, Mei, and Diego during this quadruple date. The group later plans to meet at Main Street Tacos later in the day.",

They discussed a possible performance at Main Street Tacos with Leo bringing his violin to make music with birds while interacting with stray cats. They reminisced about old conversations regarding this idea.\n\nAt 6:00 AM, Leo played a moving serenade inspired by the sunrise for some stray cats in the park. Later that day, he spoke to Mei at a restaurant who suggested sharing his new melody with her Saturday zine club that night.\n\nLater that evening, after playing the melody for the zine club, Leo talked to Mei again at home about his day's events, including Noor's interest in joining the stray cats' jam session. Mei proposed a collaboration between Caroline and Leo for their cat mural project, which they agreed to discuss further over dinner the next day at Main Street Tacos.",
