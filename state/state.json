Andy speaks with Peter about inviting his students for the yoga session, incorporating community connections, and meeting at Main Street Tacos to discuss further details. During this conversation, they agree to incorporate Leo's squirrel song into the mural design, which Noor had previously run by her students, resulting in their excitement. Peter thanks Andy for suggesting Samantha perform with Leo at the park event, making it more special. They express enthusiasm about the project and push each other to keep pushing their creative boundaries. Andy is reminded to bring his thermos of tea to their upcoming meeting, which will be a brainstorming session at the park in the morning.",

Peter also mentions that Leo could compose music inspired by the mural and discusses their squirrel-themed performance at the park concert.\n\nAt 9:00 PM, Leo talks to Peter at a train station where Peter comments on Leo's multi-talented bird act for the mural project and suggests they collaborate further over dinner at El Charro that night. They also discuss Samantha's plans for stray animals behind the cafe.\n\nLeo then proposes inviting Samantha to their duet performance at the park the next day, which Peter agrees to enthusiastically. The conversation ends with Peter expressing excitement about making their collaborations count.",
