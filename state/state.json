Don't forget about the robotics ideas for the tree and the squirrel latte art designs for our community celebration. And don't forget the cat food for the strays too.\n\nDiego: Absolutely, I won't. By the way, Leo's coming to my performance tonight. You invited him for a potential jam session afterwards, right?\n\nCaroline: Yes, he accepted but we need to keep it low-key. Let's make sure the theater guard doesn't find out!\n\nDiego: Agreed. See you later at the cafe then?\n\nCaroline: Definitely. I can't wait for our catch-up over coffee!",

Let's not forget Peter from the theater too – he might have some great suggestions. How about a quadruple date with Caroline soon, to rehearse and catch up?\n\nLeo: Great idea! Looking forward to it. By the way, I had a chat with Diego last night. He suggested adding squirrel latte art to our project – what do you think?\n\nNoor: That's exciting!
