They also consider involving the zine club and collaborating with Diego for a double date at El Charro on Thursday. Around 3:00 AM, the human talks to Peter at the hospital, who shares that he ran into Samantha at the station, and they are catching up over coffee the next day. Later, around 4:00 AM, the human talks to Andy at a cafe, where Andy proposes collaborating with Mei on her squirrel song for Leo's project. Mei agrees and suggests having a working lunch labeled \"Idea Central\" the following day to discuss it further. On the day of the lunch meeting, Mei brings seeds for the community garden as planned.",
