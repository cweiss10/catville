Spill the beans! Let's catch up on all things art and life while I whip us up some lattes.\n\nSamantha: Sounds perfect. Andy suggested we collaborate on a logic puzzle for the mural. What do you think?\n\nCaroline: That's brilliant! We should invite Noor, Peter, and perhaps even Mei from the community garden. Let's make it a double date at the cafe this weekend.\n\nSamantha: I like that idea. And maybe we could also coordinate with Diego for our community garden event this weekend.\n\nCaroline: You always know how to plan things out. I'm excited for this week to unfold, Samantha. Are you free on Tuesday? How about a coffee meeting at the museum?\n\nSamantha: That sounds perfect, Caroline. Let's discuss our collaboration ideas then. And I also have an animal art project idea I'd like to run by you.\n\nCaroline: Of course! You know I'm here for that. Let's make sure we feed those park stray animals together after our meeting.

The group also discusses a yoga session with Diego at the market before diving into creative projects.\n\nLater in the day around 1:00 PM, Leo has a conversation with Andy at a cafe. Andy is excited about Leo's improvisational piece from the previous day's rehearsal for Peter's show and is intrigued by the idea of a hidden reading nook in the park mural design. Andy suggests inviting Noor and Caroline to join the team for the project, to which Leo agrees.
