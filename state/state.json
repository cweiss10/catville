Around 3:00 AM, Andy had a conversation with Leo at school concerning his absence from busking at the market and learned that he was working on sketches for their mechanical birds project to share with Caroline under the old oak tree. Later, at around 7:00 AM, Andy talked to Noor at the park, proposing that her students could assist with Leo's mechanical birds project, and she agreed to meet him tonight under the old oak tree to finalize details for the cat mural and city sound project. They also planned a taco dinner with Leo's zine club beforehand. The collaboration for the community event continues to expand with various contributions from different individuals, including the involvement of the gym, Peter's agreement to the special drink, Noor's kitten as the event mascot, and the addition of Noor's students in the mechanical birds project.",
