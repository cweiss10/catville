Later at the train station around 5:00 AM, Andy speaks with Diego who agrees to collaborate on the symphony mural and plans to meet under the old oak tree tomorrow.\n\nIn their conversation, Andy informs Diego about Samantha joining their collaboration and suggests an AI element in the mural. Diego expresses excitement for their collaboration and asks about the latte art ideas for a performance at the museum with Mei and Leo. They discuss Andy's successful chamomile tea for the strays and Andy inquires about Diego's knee injury concerns, which are improving. Lastly, they plan the cat mural project and watering systems under the old oak tree tomorrow afternoon and Andy promises to bring the chamomile tea as agreed.",

And let's not forget Leo, Peter, and Noor – they're a big part of this town too. I suggested involving them in the collaboration to make it even stronger.\n\nCaroline: Great idea!
