They also plan to set up a meeting under the gazebo trees that evening for further discussions.\n\nAndy and Caroline express excitement about these upcoming meetings and collaborations, reminiscing about past busking days at the park during the community celebration. They also plan to catch up over coffee at an unspecified time with Caroline offering support for Andy's creative endeavors.\n\nDuring a conversation at the cafe around 11:00 AM, Andy asks Samantha about her tree project collaborations from town hall the previous day. Samantha informs Andy that the meeting was productive and they are planning to meet up on Saturday at Main Street Tacos to discuss further details. They also discuss their plans for the stray cats behind the cafe, with Caroline offering cat food for Samantha if she gets a chance.\n\nSamantha appreciates Andy's concern for the cats and collaborative spirit, and agrees to bring some food as well. They plan to catch up more about their projects at the cafe tomorrow morning.",

Mei suggests practicing their duet together on Saturday afternoon before their meeting, proposing to meet at the park around 3:00 PM.\n\nLeo talks to Peter from the theater, who shares plans to discuss incorporating robotics and musical elements into the cat mural project design with Andy. They also plan to talk about the squirrel mural event planning as well. Peter agrees to bring Noor along so she can share her robotics expertise, and they look forward to their meeting at the gazebo trees tonight.\n\nLater in the day, Leo talks to Caroline at home who invites him to join a performance by Diego tonight, sharing an extra ticket. Leo accepts the invitation, looking forward to hearing Caroline's new songs and potentially sneaking in a jam session afterwards. Caroline expresses her happiness about sharing their art together more often, stating that it makes their town special.",
