They looked forward to Main Street Tacos that evening and discussed ideas such as blending routines with an art and science theme, even incorporating squirrel tunes if possible.\n\nDuring his conversation with Mei, Diego confirmed everyone was on board for the mural project meeting and proposed a brainstorming session at Caroline's beforehand. Mei suggested a cat-themed concert where Diego's squirrel tunes might fit in. Both were excited about the unique art and science collaboration unfolding in their town.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Diego visited Caroline at her restaurant around 9:00 AM. He discussed his knee with her and requested coffee with special latte-art designs. Caroline expressed excitement for collaborating on a park project and agreed to catch up while preparing the coffee. Peter was planned to discuss collaborating with Mei and Samantha later in the week, including their cat-themed concert idea. Andy at the market was excited about Diego's surprise for the mural project and they made plans to meet that evening at the train station to discuss details further.",
