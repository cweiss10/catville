Andy learns about a meeting under the gazebo tonight with Peter and Leo to discuss the project with Samantha. He plans to bring snacks for stray cats.\n\nAndy speaks with Mei at home around 12:00 AM and proposes a meeting at Main Street Tacos tomorrow to discuss their projects in detail, including the cat mural, bird design integration, and Peter's tech skills. Andy invites Samantha, Caroline for coffee, and suggests involving Noor in their bird duet rehearsal beforehand. Mei agrees and shares that Diego has a squirrel latte art idea for the gazebo session. They plan to make it a quadruple date with everyone coming together. Andy reminds them not to forget to bring cat treats from Caroline's café for the stray cats.\n\nIn a separate conversation, Andy speaks with Diego at town_hall around 1:00 AM and learns that Diego has picked up cat treats for Leo's strays. They discuss the progress of their respective projects and Andy's solo gallery show dream. Andy also informs Diego about his meeting under the gazebo tonight with Peter and Leo, and proposes a coffee meet-up later in the week. Diego agrees to both proposals.\n\nAndy speaks with Samantha at the gym around 3:00 AM to discuss their projects and the upcoming meeting under the gazebo. Andy exchanges sunrise seeds for the gazebo trees with Samantha, who is excited about discussing their projects further over tacos tomorrow. Samantha informs Andy about her work on robotics for the mural and suggests a future meeting under the old oak tree to share notes. Andy encourages Samantha to enter the squirrel latte art contest with her cat murals, and she agrees to collaborate on their exciting projects.",

They also agreed to collaborate with Noor on the bird duet before the rehearsal, and Mei offered to bring seeds for the community garden.\n\nThey decided to make it a quadruple date by inviting Samantha as well. They planned to discuss these details over tacos at Main Street Tacos tomorrow. In the morning, they will catch up with Noor at the hospital and plan for involving stray cats in both events. Mei also reminded Leo about asking Noor about the squirrel latte art contests he mentioned earlier.
