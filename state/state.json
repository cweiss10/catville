They also discussed plans for the duet performance with birds and the squirrel latte contest. Noor suggested incorporating hazelnut cinnamon into the squirrel lattes for their contest, confirmed plans for a quadruple date at Main Street Tacos, and reminded Leo about their promise to bring his violin during their creative sessions under the gazebo trees.",
