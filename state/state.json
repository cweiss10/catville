Leo agreed to invite Peter and proposed adding music to their cat mural project. Diego then suggested they ask Samantha for chamomile for the cats since she'd been helping him with his knee injury.\n\nLeo shared that he had met Samantha at the hospital the previous night and thought she'd be a great addition to their creative endeavor.
