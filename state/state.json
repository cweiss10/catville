Later that day, Caroline talks to Andy at the library around 4:00 AM, discussing updates related to their separate mural projects. Andy reveals he's collaborating with Samantha on a project incorporating city sounds and mechanical birds.\n\nCaroline then speaks to Mei at the library around 6:00 AM, suggesting her garden as the perfect setting for the mechanical bird design in their mural. Mei agrees and proposes practicing under the old oak tree that evening over mint tea, also inviting Noor and the garden's choir for an improvised duet during taco night. Both agree to maintain the cozy vibe of the community event.",

Later, Mei talks to Caroline at home about incorporating students into the project and suggests mint tea for the meeting. They also discuss bringing seeds for the community garden to the meeting.\n\nAt around 2:00 AM, Mei talks to Peter in the hospital where they appreciate each other's efforts for their project. Mei proposes noise-cancelling headphones as a game changer and they discuss Leo's violin serenade under the oak tree, Noor's suggestion of noise-cancelling headphones, and how they might have found a recipe for successful collaborations.\n\nLater, at a train station around 3:00 AM, Mei meets Andy who shares a passion for art. Mei invites Andy to collaborate on the cat mural project, and Andy agrees, suggesting they gather their friends under the old oak tree the next day. They decide to create a soothing atmosphere with chamomile lattes, noise-cancelling headphones, and seeds brought by Mei for the mural garden. Andy looks forward to their creative journey together.",
