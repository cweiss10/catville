Later, Diego informs Andy about successfully convincing Caroline to join their project and discuss her musical ideas under the gazebo the next afternoon. The team remains enthusiastic about the project's progress.\n\nOn the following day, Andy treats everyone after their meetings. Their collaboration continues to be productive and looks promising for the cat mural project. During a conversation with Diego at a restaurant around 10:00 AM, Andy thanks Diego for joining the project and reminds him about their promise of chamomile tea for stray cats during their morning run. Later, in a conversation with Leo at the train station around 12:00 PM, Andy suggests incorporating Leo's violin melodies into the cat mural project and invites Peter and Mei to join as well. Both agree on gathering under the gazebo that afternoon for further discussions and bringing chamomile tea for stray cats.",

Let's grab some street tacos and chamomile tea under that old oak tree near the school tomorrow at noon. I've been thinking about how Mei might contribute too.\n\nDiego: Sounds perfect. Count me in for that run early in the morning, and don't forget your thermos of tea!\n\nNoor: Will do! Looking forward to our collaboration, Diego. See you tomorrow.",

How did your meeting go?\n\nNoor: It went great! Caroline suggested inviting you to collaborate on the music part. I think your soothing rhythms would be perfect.

Leo and Mei looked forward to their meeting the following day, where they would also share ideas about latte art and community garden plants.\n\nLeo later spoke with Caroline at the museum around 7:00 AM, where she revealed a new addition for the mural - a song inspired by the sunrise seeds Leo had mentioned earlier. Excited about this development, Leo made plans to meet near the old oak tree tomorrow at dusk with his collected twigs and leaves for improvised instruments. Caroline also shared that Diego was excited about contributing to the mural as well.\n\nLater, at the train station around 8:00 AM, Andy reached out to Leo inviting him to join a meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow where they could brainstorm ideas, possibly create a bird duet for the occasion, and bring chamomile for stray cats. Andy also mentioned that he had been talking to Diego about the project and suggested inviting Caroline and more team members for a discussion under the gazebo the day after.
