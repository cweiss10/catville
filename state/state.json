In addition, Peter suggests a sunrise serenade for their quadruple date, which is agreed upon by all parties. Diego also proposes collaborating on the sunrise seeds idea and arranges a dinner date at Main Street Tacos for Leo and Noor tomorrow night.\n\nLeo has found the improbable spare parts Caroline requested, and they have decided to start their music session under the gazebo trees tonight. They will also bring chamomile tea. Additionally, Leo plans to warm up before their quadruple date with a violin performance at Main Street Tacos. Caroline is excited about their creative sparks flying and believes they can give the town an unforgettable night that everyone will talk about for weeks.",
