Andy proposed inviting Diego to join them at Caroline's Café the next day to collaborate on sound systems and noise-cancelling headphones for the mural, an idea Peter agreed to. Additionally, Peter discussed pattern work with Samantha and mentioned that Noor's kids would also be helping with painting. Andy suggested bringing cat food and snacks for their collaboration session.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation at the museum around 12:00 AM, Peter discussed his new idea of meeting Diego and others to brainstorm design elements for the cat mural project at Caroline's Café instead of the park as originally planned. Mei agreed to this change and suggested turning it into a brainstorming session over tacos. Later in another conversation at home around 1:00 AM, Peter discussed the cat mural plans further with Caroline over coffee at her café.

I just need to finalize a few details with them. I was hoping you could join us at the community center later today to work on those together.\n\nNoor: Absolutely, Andy! Let's make this collaboration something special for our park and the kids we mentor. See you soon!\n\n(Later that day)\n\nAndy: Noor, I just got some chamomile seeds from Peter at the library. He promised to bring them for the mural project as we discussed.\n\nNoor: That's fantastic, Andy! Thank you for making sure everything is coming together.

They also made plans to meet under the old oak tree with Andy over the weekend to chat about mechanical bird ideas for the mural.\n\nAt 4:00 PM, Leo talked to Noor at the gym about the mural plans, sharing that they would both contribute elements from the old oak tree to the project. Noor also offered seeds for the community garden. Later in the day, Leo spoke with Diego at home around 9:00 PM, discussing bringing mechanical birds and street tacos to their mural rehearsal, recalling their old busking duets under the oak tree. Diego suggested checking out improvisation tricks Samantha showed Leo for the bird melodies. Both agreed to keep each other updated as they worked on different aspects of the project.",
