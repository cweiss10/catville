Yes, I tried them out this morning during my practice session at Caroline's Café. It really helped block out the noise and focus on the notes. Thanks for suggesting it! By the way, Stray-13 is excited about Andy's taco party idea under the old oak tree.\n\nSamantha: That sounds like a fun gathering! I'm looking forward to it as well. Also, I'd love to bring my ideas on tech input for your robotics club tomorrow. Stray-13 can't wait to join too!\n\nNoor: Excellent! We could use some innovative tech solutions for our projects.
