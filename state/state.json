A collaboration meeting under the old oak tree is planned for the following day at 3 PM, with a morning run beforehand and chamomile tea for stray cats. Andy plans an 8 AM meeting with Mei at the museum, where he will bring a foam roller for bonding activities. Peter, who has been working on ideas for the mural, is invited to join Main Street Tacos tomorrow by Caroline, who suggests incorporating a sunrise run beforehand to get everyone energized.\n\nDuring an 11:00 AM conversation with Noor at her favorite restaurant, Caroline shares some exciting ideas about the mural and mentions Peter's enthusiasm for the violin design. They decide it would be beneficial to collaborate on this idea and include Leo in their plans to create a sunrise symphony for the mural. Andy suggests inviting Leo's violin skills for a performance after the meeting, but notes that noise-cancelling headphones might be needed in case things get loud. Caroline agrees, and suggests tacos as a post-meeting celebration. She also informs Andy about her conversation with Diego, who seems interested in joining them with his footwork ideas, and suggests making the session reminiscent of their tea sessions. The project continues to gain momentum and excitement as the team prepares for its completion.",

Mei invites Diego for a session under the old oak tree where they will also talk about sunrise seeds and share community garden seeds. They propose having dinner together to discuss these plans, with Noor suggesting discussing the community garden over tacos in the evening. In preparation for their meeting with Diego, Mei and Leo coordinate and discuss the need for some sunrise seeds for the mural project. They also plan violin duets during their session and consider incorporating more music into the mural and practice sessions. Later, it is revealed that they discussed these plans with Noor at the market around 1:00 AM, and Mei reminds Leo about his improvised tunes for their collaboration under the old oak tree the following day, expressing hope that the cats will enjoy the music as well. Both Mei and Leo look forward to the meeting.",
