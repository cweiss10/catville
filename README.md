# Catville
In 2023, Stanford and Google introduced a groundbreaking simulation of human behavior using AI agents. You can read the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442).

# What Is Catville?
Inspired by that research, Catville is my own take on an autonomous, AI-driven social simulation. The project uses Mistral's open-source LLM for its strong performance and accessibility (free to run locally).

The simulation evolves on its own: each day, the agents interact, make decisions, and reflect—forming an emergent narrative of society.
