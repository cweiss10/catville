Mei: I couldn't agree more. Let's also invite Samantha and Diego to join us for dinner; it'll be great catching up with them too. Plus, we can discuss planting sunrise seeds for stray cats during our work sessions, as Peter suggested.

Andy: Absolutely! Looking forward to it, Mei. Let's make this project something special for our community and furry friends alike.

Andy: That sounds really cool, Peter! Let's definitely talk more about it tonight at the taco place. By the way, Diego mentioned your enthusiasm for my collaboration with Mei on music—I can't wait to hear more of that!
 Mei: "Leo, I found some sunrise seeds at the market – perfect for our gazebo garden! Let's start a new tradition."

Leo: "Brilliant idea, Mei! And speaking of traditions, let's not forget to feed those stray cats before we start. We wouldn't want to miss our furry muses!"

Mei: "Absolutely! I've even asked Samantha to join us at Main Street Tacos for a quadruple date. She might have some interesting insights for the mural project."

Leo: "That sounds wonderful, Mei! Let's make this collaboration as inclusive and inspiring as possible. How about an interactive latte art activity under the gazebo trees?"

Mei: "I love it! I'll bring my tote with seeds for both the garden and the cats."

Leo: "Sounds like a plan! Can't wait to see our cat mural come alive, and strengthen our community even more."

Diego: Hi Samantha! Yeah, it should be a great team-building experience. And don't worry, I'll make sure to feed the strays beforehand as you suggested. Let's run together tomorrow morning too? It'll help us both improve our fitness.

Samantha: That sounds perfect, Diego. I'll see you at 6:00 AM sharp! And don't forget your headphones for the bird duet on Sunday.

Diego: You got it! Can't wait to hear your new algorithm in action. See you soon, Samantha.
