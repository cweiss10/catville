Mei: I couldn't agree more. Let's also invite Samantha and Diego to join us for dinner; it'll be great catching up with them too. Plus, we can discuss planting sunrise seeds for stray cats during our work sessions, as Peter suggested.

Andy: That sounds really cool, Peter! Let's definitely talk more about it tonight at the taco place. By the way, Diego mentioned your enthusiasm for my collaboration with Mei on music—I can't wait to hear more of that!
 Mei: "Leo, I found some sunrise seeds at the market – perfect for our gazebo garden! Let's start a new tradition."

Leo: "Brilliant idea, Mei! And speaking of traditions, let's not forget to feed those stray cats before we start. We wouldn't want to miss our furry muses!"

Mei: "Absolutely! I've even asked Samantha to join us at Main Street Tacos for a quadruple date. She might have some interesting insights for the mural project."

Leo: "That sounds wonderful, Mei! Let's make this collaboration as inclusive and inspiring as possible. How about an interactive latte art activity under the gazebo trees?"

Samantha: That sounds perfect, Diego. I'll see you at 6:00 AM sharp! And don't forget your headphones for the bird duet on Sunday.

Diego: You got it! Can't wait to hear your new algorithm in action. See you soon, Samantha.

Caroline: "That sounds delightful! And don't forget to invite your feathered friends for the duet performance, it'll be a hit!"

Leo: "Of course, Caroline. It's going to be an extraordinary event. Let's make sure we discuss the science elements tonight at Main Street Tacos as well."
