 Samantha: "Hey Caroline, I found some interesting patterns for the cat mural – thought we could discuss them under the gazebo trees this afternoon?"

Caroline: "Sounds perfect! Bring your headphones, and let's see how we can combine our ideas. Maybe we can even get Andy to help with the latte art?"

Samantha: "I'll do that – and thanks for reminding me about my headphones again. Your enthusiasm is contagious!"

Caroline: "You're welcome! And it's all because of your inspiring work, Samantha. Don't forget to feed the strays behind the cafe on our way!"
