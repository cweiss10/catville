Peter: Sunrise seeds, huh? That sounds exciting! Looking forward to our creative gathering tomorrow as well. By the way, how's your violin playing coming along for our double date with Caroline and Andy?

Peter: Absolutely, Mei. It seems like our project is really bringing everyone together. Speaking of which, have you heard about Leo's idea for an improvised symphony to accompany the mural?

Mei: Indeed I have! I can't wait to hear it in person. Let's make sure we gather everyone at Main Street Tacos next weekend as planned, and discuss details further over some tacos, don't you think?

Plus, I thought it would be nice if we could work together on maintaining the cozy vibe of our projects, like what we did with the cat mural.

Diego: Sounds fantastic! Can't wait to help out and learn more from your creative process too. See you at Main Street Tacos tonight then?

Andy: Absolutely, let's discuss it over some tacos. And don't forget about the chamomile tea for stray cats near Main Street, as per our conversation with Caroline.
