Peter: Sunrise seeds, huh? That sounds exciting! Looking forward to our creative gathering tomorrow as well. By the way, how's your violin playing coming along for our double date with Caroline and Andy?

"Hey Diego, I saw your running route this morning – impressive timing! Did you grab those street tacos? I've got some ideas for the mural if you're free for coffee at Main Street later?"

Peter: Absolutely, Mei. It seems like our project is really bringing everyone together. Speaking of which, have you heard about Leo's idea for an improvised symphony to accompany the mural?

Mei: Indeed I have! I can't wait to hear it in person. Let's make sure we gather everyone at Main Street Tacos next weekend as planned, and discuss details further over some tacos, don't you think?

Peter: Sounds perfect, Mei. Looking forward to it. Let's also catch up on how your zine club is doing – maybe we can incorporate some of those creative ideas into our mural too!
