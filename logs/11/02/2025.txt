Peter: "Sounds like a plan, Andy! I've been meaning to discuss using sunrise seeds in our design. How about we grab some street tacos beforehand, make it a quadruple date? It could be magical."

Andy: "I like that idea, Peter. The four of us... it feels right. Looking forward to it."

Peter: "Me too, Andy. This project has such potential and I can't wait to see where it takes us."
