 Andy: "I've got an idea for tonight, Peter. How about we have that brainstorming session under the gazebo with Noor and a few others? I thought it could be fun to make it a more inclusive evening before our rehearsal."

Peter: "Sounds like a plan, Andy! I've been meaning to discuss using sunrise seeds in our design. How about we grab some street tacos beforehand, make it a quadruple date? It could be magical."

Andy: "I like that idea, Peter. The four of us... it feels right. Looking forward to it."

Peter: "Me too, Andy. This project has such potential and I can't wait to see where it takes us."
 Samantha: "Hey Mei, I heard you were working on something exciting with Diego and Leo for the cat mural. Care to join us for some latte art brainstorming post-project? Caroline suggested it."

Mei: "That sounds wonderful, Samantha! Let's make sure we bring our noise-cancelling headphones to keep focused. I think Leo's violin would be a perfect addition to our gathering under the gazebo trees."
