Mei (cafe): Indeed, we're meeting under that old oak tree tomorrow to discuss it further. Speaking of which, have you tried the sunrise seeds I gave you? They'd make a great addition to your street tacos!

Diego (town hall): Ah yes, the sunrise seeds! I did try them and they were delightful. And about the improv session, Caroline mentioned that Noor has a surprise performance planned. Exciting times ahead for our town!
