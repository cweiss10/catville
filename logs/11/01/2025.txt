Leo: "Thanks, Mei! I was hoping to share it with a community as vibrant and creative as yours. Let's make sure Noor is there too."

Mei: "Absolutely, I'll remind Peter about introducing you both during our brainstorming session under the gazebo trees tomorrow."

Leo: "Sounds great! And I've got an idea for those sunrise seeds you mentioned. We could use them in our brainstorming sessions before our collaborations start."

Mei: "That's a wonderful thought, Leo. Let's see how it goes with the zine club first. I think they'll love it!"
