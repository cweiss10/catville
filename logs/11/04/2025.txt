Andy is at the restaurant.
Samantha is at the town_hall.
Caroline is at the hospital.
Peter is at the theater.
Mei is at the school.
Diego is at the hospital.
Noor is at the train_station.
Leo is at the park.
 Caroline: Hey Diego, have you heard about our squirrel latte contest collaboration with Leo?

Diego: Oh, absolutely! I think Noor would be a great addition to that. Speaking of which, did you hear we're all meeting at Main Street Tacos next week for the cat mural project?

Caroline: Yes! It's going to be quite the gathering. And don't forget our usual Sunday morning cat feeding session.

Diego: Right, and I also talked to Andy about incorporating his latte art into the design. Maybe we can have a little sneak peek during the event?

Caroline: That sounds amazing! By the way, Leo mentioned a bird duet performance with some noise-cancelling headphones. Have you thought about inviting kids from the community center to join in?

Diego: Great idea! Let's coordinate with Samantha on that too. I hope everything goes as smoothly as our usual collaborations here at the cafe.

Andy is at the train_station.
Samantha is at the home.
Caroline is at the museum.
Peter is at the library.
Mei is at the theater.
Diego is at the library.
Noor is at the restaurant.
Leo is at the theater.
 Peter: Hey Diego, I was thinking about our cat mural project and thought Noor might be a great addition with her science background.

Diego: That sounds like a good idea, Peter. Let's invite her to the brainstorming session under the gazebo trees tomorrow. I also spoke with Andy about incorporating his latte art into the design.

Peter: Oh yeah? I could bring sunrise seeds for the stray cats before our meeting on Sunday. What do you think?

Diego: That's a thoughtful idea, Peter. And speaking of collaborations, have you talked to Mei about her musical contributions yet?

Peter: Not yet, but I will. She seems excited about working with Leo on music. We should make it a tradition to plan over tacos under the gazebo trees.
 Mei: Hey Leo, I was just talking with Samantha at the museum. She wants us all for dinner tomorrow at Main Street Tacos.

Leo: That sounds great! I was discussing that with Diego too. We can make it a quadruple date. Oh, and he mentioned inviting Sam for our project, think she'd be a good fit?

Mei: Absolutely, her scientific insights could be really valuable. And don't forget to bring seeds for the stray cats behind the cafe, as you and Sam suggested.

Leo: Right! Speaking of that, Diego also thought we should start using those sunrise seeds at our gatherings, like a tradition. Excited for what's in store tomorrow evening under the gazebo trees!
