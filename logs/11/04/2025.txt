Andy is at the restaurant.
Samantha is at the town_hall.
Caroline is at the hospital.
Peter is at the theater.
Mei is at the school.
Diego is at the hospital.
Noor is at the train_station.
Leo is at the park.
 Caroline: Hey Diego, have you heard about our squirrel latte contest collaboration with Leo?

Diego: Oh, absolutely! I think Noor would be a great addition to that. Speaking of which, did you hear we're all meeting at Main Street Tacos next week for the cat mural project?

Caroline: Yes! It's going to be quite the gathering. And don't forget our usual Sunday morning cat feeding session.

Diego: Right, and I also talked to Andy about incorporating his latte art into the design. Maybe we can have a little sneak peek during the event?

Caroline: That sounds amazing! By the way, Leo mentioned a bird duet performance with some noise-cancelling headphones. Have you thought about inviting kids from the community center to join in?

Diego: Great idea! Let's coordinate with Samantha on that too. I hope everything goes as smoothly as our usual collaborations here at the cafe.
