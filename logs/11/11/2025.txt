--- 1:00 AM ---
Samantha is at the park.
Caroline is at the hospital.
Mei is at the library.
Diego is at the town_hall.
Noor is at the cafe.
Leo is at the library.
 Mei: "Good evening, Leo! I see you've been practicing your melodies under the gazebo trees. The cats must be quite entertained."

Leo: "Ah, Mei! Always a pleasure to play for those furry friends. It's quite inspiring, isn't it? Have you decided on which seeds we should use for our cat mural project?"

Mei: "Yes, I spoke with Caroline and we agreed on the sunrise seeds. I was also thinking about incorporating your improvisations into our meetings, like tonight at 8 PM."

Leo: "Sounds delightful! I'll bring my violin and some chamomile tea for focus, as Andy suggested. Are you still planning on that quadruple date at Main Street Tacos?"

Mei: "Indeed! I invited Peter, who's excited to join the collaboration and even promised sunrise seeds for stray cats. Looking forward to it."
 Andy: Hey Diego, running a bit late from the gym? I was just headed there for my morning sketch session.

Diego: Hey Andy! Not at all, I got some time before our double date tonight. Speaking of which, I met Leo this morning and we're combining our cat mural projects with your sunrise seeds idea.

Andy: That sounds fantastic! I've been thinking about involving Noor too. She's really taken to the sunrise seeds concept. How about we all meet under that old oak tree at 6:30 AM tomorrow?

Diego: Count me in. Let's make it a group run through the park before dinner at Main Street Tacos, just like the old times.

Andy: You got it! See you there. And remember to bring your stretches and street tacos. :)
