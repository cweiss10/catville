Mei: Hello Peter! Yes, preparing the seeds for tonight's mural work. And how's the cat mural progressing with Diego and Leo?

Peter: It's coming along nicely. We're adding a squirrel latte element now, thanks to our late-night chat with Samantha at the museum.

Mei: Ah, I heard about that! Sounds exciting. I thought we might collaborate on something extraordinary for the mural too, you know, using sunrise seeds from my garden.

Peter: That sounds perfect, Mei. Collaboration is key to making a great impact in our community. Let's make this project truly special.
