 Samantha: Hey Diego, I hope your knee is feeling better after our morning run at the oak tree yesterday.

Diego: Good morning, Sam! Yes, the stretches you showed me are really helping. By the way, we have a lot to discuss for the cat mural project today. Let's grab some of those delicious street tacos at Main Street after town hall?

Samantha: Sounds great! I've been thinking about ways to incorporate your morning runs under the oak tree into our plans, and maybe we can use Noor's sunrise seeds too? Don't forget the chamomile tea for the stray cats. See you at town hall!
