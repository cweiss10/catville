 Andy: Hey Peter, I was thinking about our cat mural project and how we could tie in the squirrel latte design from my gym. What do you think?

Peter: That's an interesting idea, Andy. I like the symmetry of incorporating sunrise seeds into both designs. Let's discuss more at dinner under the gazebo tonight.

Andy: Sounds perfect. I was also hoping to discuss inviting you to join our team. What do you say?

Peter: I'd be honored, Andy. Let's make this project a success together.
 Caroline: "Hey Diego, I hope you're feeling better after that knee injury. I heard about your taco gathering under the old oak tree – can't wait!"

Diego: "Hey Caroline! Good to see you too. Yeah, the tacos with Leo's sunrise seeds have been a game-changer. And speaking of music, how's the improv singing session going at the gazebo? Peter mentioned it."

Caroline: "It's coming along nicely. Peter and I were just discussing it with Leo earlier – we think your fitness crowd would love it! Hopefully, we can bring everyone closer that way."

Diego: "I agree! It'll be great to collaborate. Let's catch up more about this later tonight after work. See you at Main Street Tacos?"

Caroline: "Sounds perfect! I'll save you a seat."
