 Diego: Hey Noor, have you heard about that creative night event under the gazebo? I think your improv number would be a perfect fit!

Noor: Hey Diego! That sounds amazing! I've been practicing some new moves for just such an occasion. How about we grab some street tacos and stretch together at the old oak tree before the symphony?

Diego: Absolutely, I'd love that! And don't forget to bring those sunrise seeds you gave me for my tacos.

Noor: You got it! Let's make sure to catch up about our projects too, since we both have a lot going on. See you at the old oak tree!
