 Caroline: Hey Mei, I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about our chat at the theater and Peter's suggestion for the sunrise seeds in the squirrel latte designs.

Mei: Hi Caroline! Yes, it's an intriguing idea! I'm bringing some seeds from my garden to the gathering at Main Street Tacos tonight, as we discussed. How about you?

Caroline: Perfect! I also talked with Diego and he agreed to have a quadruple date there. Plus, I suggested some improv music performances. It's shaping up to be quite an event!

Mei: That sounds amazing, Caroline! And I can't wait to discuss the design details more with you and Samantha tomorrow. Let's make sure this cat mural brings our community together even more.
