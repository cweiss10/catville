 Peter: Hey Mei, been thinking about our cat mural project with the zine club. I spoke with Caroline and Noor, they're excited to collaborate.

Mei: That sounds fantastic, Peter! I had a great chat with Samantha too, she's eager to join us. I'll bring Leo's violin to our meeting at the gazebo tomorrow.

Peter: Brilliant! Let's make sure not to forget our noise-cancelling headphones and Diego's street tacos for a tradition. Excited to see this come together, Mei.

Mei: Absolutely, Peter. It seems like it'll be a wonderful collaboration. And remember, let's feed the stray cats on Sunday morning as part of our event plans.
