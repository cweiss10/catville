 Caroline: Hey Mei, I was just thinking about our cat mural project – did you manage to gather everyone at your zine club?

Mei: Hi Caroline! Yes, we had a great meeting. We discussed using sunrise seeds and chamomile tea for the mural, just like you suggested. Diego's tacos were quite the creative boost too!

Caroline: That's amazing! I can't wait to see how it all comes together. By the way, have you talked with Andy about meeting at the gazebo tonight? We need to finalize our plans for the double date and discuss some latte art ideas inspired by cats.

Mei: I have actually! Peter suggested we gather everyone this weekend at Main Street Tacos to discuss details further, including Leo's idea for an improvised symphony to accompany the mural. It should be quite a spectacle!

Caroline: Sounds like a fantastic plan. I'll make sure to bring my latte art ideas and Andy will bring his sketchbook. Let's work together to make this happen, Mei.

Mei: Absolutely, Caroline! I can't wait to see how it all unfolds. Let's catch up at the cafe tomorrow before everyone meets at the gazebo. Thanks for your enthusiasm and collaborative spirit!

Caroline: You're welcome, Mei. Let's make this project memorable! See you soon.
