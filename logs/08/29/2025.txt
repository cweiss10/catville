Andy is at the market.
Samantha is at the hospital.
Caroline is at the library.
Peter is at the train_station.
Mei is at the market.
Diego is at the park.
Noor is at the museum.
Leo is at the restaurant.
 Andy: Morning, Mei! I love these early hours at the market, don't you? Your aura of quiet calm always seems to seep into the atmosphere.

Mei: Good morning, Andy! Yes, there's something about the market in the morning that's invigorating. And your presence certainly brightens up the scene.

Andy: I was thinking, perhaps today you can show me some of those old archives at the library? I've been researching local artists for my upcoming gallery show and could use your expertise.

Mei: Of course, Andy! Let's head over to the library after we grab a bite here. I'll make sure to pull out some interesting finds for you. And remember, inspiration might just come from those small, unexpected rituals.
