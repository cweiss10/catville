 Noor: "Hey Leo! Ran into Samantha at school today. She said you've been discussing our mechanical bird project with Diego and Peter."

Leo: "That's right, Noor! We even invited Andy and Caroline for a double date under the oak tree tomorrow. I thought it would be great to have everyone's creative input."

Noor: "I love that idea! And speaking of ideas, you mentioned incorporating city sounds too. That should make for an interesting blend with the bird songs."

Leo: "Indeed! I'm excited to see how this all comes together. Looking forward to our extraordinary evening under the old oak tree."
 Andy: Hey Diego, great seeing you again! I've been thinking about our mural project and your idea with the mechanical birds sounds fantastic.

Diego: Good to see you too, Andy. I'm glad you like it. I was hoping you could bring in Leo and maybe Noor's robotics club for some unique elements. How about showcasing it at Caroline's open mic night?

Andy: That sounds amazing! Let's collaborate with Samantha as well, and make sure we include her new components. And don't forget the stray animals, like Noor suggested.

Diego: Absolutely, Andy. I'll remind Samantha to bring her noise-cancelling headphones. We should meet again soon to coordinate everyone's contributions.
