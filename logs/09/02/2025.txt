 Samantha: Hey Noor, I couldn't help but notice your latte art skills at the gym this morning. Have you ever considered collaborating on a project?

Noor: Samantha! That's a great idea! I was thinking about incorporating some experiments for our mural projects. What do you think about bringing the kids from our clubs too?

Samantha: I like it. Let's meet at the community garden next week to plan and get everyone excited. And maybe you can show me around your artists' archives while we're there?

Noor: Absolutely! I'll bring my noise-cancelling headphones for a quiet workspace, and remember to discuss details about our collaboration with Caroline too. See you there!
