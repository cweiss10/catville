Noor: Samantha! That's a great idea! I was thinking about incorporating some experiments for our mural projects. What do you think about bringing the kids from our clubs too?

Samantha: I like it. Let's meet at the community garden next week to plan and get everyone excited. And maybe you can show me around your artists' archives while we're there?

Noor: Absolutely! I'll bring my noise-cancelling headphones for a quiet workspace, and remember to discuss details about our collaboration with Caroline too. See you there!

(Later that day)

 Andy: Hey Leo, how was your night? I heard about the parrot!

Leo: Hi Andy! It was quite an eventful one indeed. The parrot was a surprise, aren't they always interesting characters? How about yours? I've heard about your gallery show on Saturday. Excited?

Andy: Absolutely! But you know me, a bit nervous too. We've been planning for it since our mural collaboration at the park last summer. Speaking of which, have you talked to Noor or Mei lately?

Leo: Yes, I just spoke with Noor about our collaborations. I plan on joining Mei's club as well this week. Looks like we both have a lot to look forward to! Let's catch up soon and maybe even plan a double date with Diego this weekend.
