Caroline: Indeed! And it seems we're on the same wavelength with our ideas about the park animals. Have you talked to Noor yet? We should really grab some street tacos after work to discuss further.

 Peter: Hey Diego, how's that knee feeling? I saw you hobbling at the park the other day.

Diego: Hey Peter, thanks for asking! It's improving slowly but surely with some extra stretching these days. How'd your meeting with Caroline go?
