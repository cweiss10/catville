Andy is at the school.
Samantha is at the park.
Caroline is at the cafe.
Mei is at the cafe.
Diego is at the town_hall.
Noor is at the library.
Leo is at the market.
 Caroline: Hey Mei! Your usual, right?
Mei: Good morning, Caroline! Yes, thank you. I see you've been busy with the mural project. Peter mentioned your collaboration plans with Samantha and Diego.

Caroline: Indeed! And it seems we're on the same wavelength with our ideas about the park animals. Have you talked to Noor yet? We should really grab some street tacos after work to discuss further.

Mei: That sounds perfect, Caroline. I'll invite Noor and we can catch up while planning the details for our art pieces. Let's aim for Thursday evening at the cafe, shall we?

Caroline: Agreed! Looking forward to it. And if there's any gossip or connections you need help with, just let me know.

Mei: Thank you, Caroline. I appreciate your support and I'm excited for this collaboration. Let's make our towns a little more magical together.
 Peter: Hey Diego, how's that knee feeling? I saw you hobbling at the park the other day.

Diego: Hey Peter, thanks for asking! It's improving slowly but surely with some extra stretching these days. How'd your meeting with Caroline go?

Peter: Oh, it was great! She seems really excited about our potential collaboration on the gallery show. I thought you might be interested too, considering the mural project we discussed at the market. What do you think?

Diego: That sounds like a fantastic idea, Peter. Let's make sure to discuss more about both projects during our taco meeting this week, and don't forget Noor as well. It'll be great to brainstorm together!
