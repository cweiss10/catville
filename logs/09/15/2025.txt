Andy: Oh, I haven't! But I'm excited to find out. Speaking of surprises, Peter suggested a double date at Main Street Tacos this Thursday. Would you be up for it?

Caroline: Of course not, Sam! That sounds perfect. And speaking of collaborations, Noor and I are planning to involve the robotics club with your café's stray cats.

Samantha: That's fantastic, Caroline! I'm excited to see how everything comes together. Let's make sure the strays get some treats too.

Caroline: Absolutely! We should coordinate with Peter and Andy for a joint library-cafe event this weekend, don't you think?

Samantha: Yes, we have! It's going to be great. Are you ready for those stretches?

Noor: You bet! I've been practicing all week, and I can't wait to see everyone there. Let's make sure we help Leo stay energized too, right?

Samantha: Of course! He's a trooper, but those logic puzzles can be exhausting. We should bring some snacks for him.

Noor: Agreed! And maybe we could involve the robotics club students at Caroline's Cafe with the stray cats? They love helping out, and it would be great for the community.

Samantha: That sounds wonderful, Noor. I think everyone will really appreciate that effort. See you soon!

Noor: Looking forward to it, Samantha! Let's keep in touch about the mural project details and squirrel song collaborations at El Charro later on. Bye for now!

Andy: Agreed! I think Leo will really appreciate it. And speaking of him, we should make sure he stays energized during our brainstorming sessions.

Diego: You're right about that. Let's also remember to invite Samantha; her input would be invaluable for the logic puzzles and cat nook design.

Andy: I couldn't agree more! I already talked with her, and she's on board. Looking forward to our coffee catch-up at El Charro soon.

Diego: Same here, Andy. Let's keep this creative momentum going. And I'll bring sunflower seeds for the community garden to our meeting on Thursday. Cheers!

Andy: Sounds perfect, Diego. Thanks for being such a great collaborator and friend. See you soon!
