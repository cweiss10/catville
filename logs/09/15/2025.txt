Andy: Oh, I haven't! But I'm excited to find out. Speaking of surprises, Peter suggested a double date at Main Street Tacos this Thursday. Would you be up for it?

Mei: That sounds delightful, Andy! I'd love to catch up and discuss the mural project in person. And perhaps we could work on those logic puzzles over the weekend as well?

Andy: Absolutely, let's make a plan for Saturday at your community garden. Thanks for being such a great collaborator, Mei!

Mei: Likewise, Andy. Let's make this mural a masterpiece that our town will love!
 Samantha: Hey Caroline, I hope you don't mind me bringing up the surprise event again. Peter suggested a squirrel song for the kids.

Caroline: Of course not, Sam! That sounds perfect. And speaking of collaborations, Noor and I are planning to involve the robotics club with your caf√©'s stray cats.

Samantha: That's fantastic, Caroline! I'm excited to see how everything comes together. Let's make sure the strays get some treats too.

Caroline: Absolutely! We should coordinate with Peter and Andy for a joint library-cafe event this weekend, don't you think?

Samantha: Agreed. I can't wait to see everyone gathered here. And thank you for being such an amazing partner in all of this, Caroline.

Caroline: Aww, Samantha! It's always a pleasure working with you. Here's to making our little corner of the world even better. üçª

Samantha: That sounds perfect. Let's set up a quiet corner at the library to discuss the progress without disturbing others, if that works for you?

Caroline: Absolutely! And since Andy will be there, I can invite him as well. We should coordinate via email with everyone to make sure we don't miss any details.
