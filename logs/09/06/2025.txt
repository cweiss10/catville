 Mei: Hey Diego, I just wanted to follow up on our chat about the mural project. How's that knee injury coming along?

Diego: Good, thanks for asking! It's feeling much better, and I'm excited to help out with the mural. I reached out to Samantha from the theater like we discussed, and she's on board with the interactive mini lab station idea.

Mei: That's fantastic news! And speaking of collaborations, I thought Noor might be interested in joining us at the community garden this weekend for our brainstorming sessions. What do you think?

Diego: Absolutely, she'd bring great ideas to the table. Let's also invite Leo, I know he'd love to contribute too. How about we all meet up next week at the community garden gathering?

Mei: Sounds perfect! Let's keep working together to make this project a success and strengthen our town's community.
