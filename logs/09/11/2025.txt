 Samantha: Hey Caroline, thanks for bringing up that mural project at dinner. I've been thinking about it all day.

Caroline: You too? It's so exciting! Did you discuss the yoga elements with Peter like we planned?

Samantha: Yes, he invited me for dinner to delve deeper into stretching techniques. And I talked to Mei about involving Noor's robotics club in our project. They might join us on Tuesday at your house.

Caroline: Oh wow! That sounds fantastic. Maybe we can have a double date night this weekend too, like you mentioned? I should invite Peter and everyone else involved.

Samantha: Sounds perfect. Looking forward to it! And thanks again for inviting me to that improvisation session; I'll make sure to catch it next time.

Caroline: No problem at all, Samantha. I'm glad we can collaborate on this project and bring our unique perspectives together. See you at the park tomorrow!
