Diego: Absolutely, Andy! I was thinking Main Street Tacos, they have a great ambiance. As for the outfits, I suggest a crisp shirt and jeans - nothing too formal but definitely sharp. You'll look amazing!

Andy: Thanks for the tip! I can't wait to see Noor join our mural project. I think her creative abilities will really add something special.

Diego: I couldn't agree more, Andy. She's going to bring a unique energy that we could definitely use in our fitness-focused design elements. Let's make sure to discuss it further at the museum on Tuesday.
 Mei: "Hey Leo, I heard about your musical plans for the mural. It sounds fascinating! Maybe you could play something at our double date this weekend?"

Leo: "That's a great idea, Mei! I think the zine club would love an impromptu performance after my busking session. How about we coordinate so we can both share our passions?"

Mei: That's a wonderful idea, Peter! Perhaps we could incorporate a hidden reading nook into the design. And speaking of quiet spaces, have you seen my new seedlings for the community garden?

Peter: I haven't had a chance yet, but I'd love to help tend them sometime. Maybe we can work on the mural while taking care of our little green friends.

Mei: That sounds perfect! Plus, it would give us a chance to bond over our shared passions for community improvement and quiet spaces. Let's make this town stronger together.
 Andy: Hey Caroline, I just had a great call with Samantha about our mural project. We're thinking of trying out that new taco place on Main Street this weekend.

Andy: Not yet, but we have a coffee meeting planned for Friday to discuss it all. How about a quadruple date with Diego too? What do you think?
