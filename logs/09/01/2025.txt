Mei: Hi Andy! Yes, it sounds wonderful. I've also been brainstorming some ideas for the design, such as incorporating herbs from the community garden. Looking forward to our meeting tomorrow!

Diego: Hey Mei, how about we plan dinner this week? We have a lot to discuss regarding our yoga session for the zine club and my knee injury recovery progress.

Mei: Diego, that sounds like a great idea! I think it will be productive and fun. Let's finalize the details over our usual Thursday coffee. See you then!
 Caroline: Hey Diego, running a bit late from your EMT shift?
Diego: You got me, Caroline! Just needed to stretch after that call. Appreciate the invite though, let's grab that coffee at the taqueria you mentioned.

Caroline: Perfect timing then. I heard about your knee injury and the yoga session with Mei at the community center. Sounds like a great way to heal up!
Diego: Absolutely! And speaking of collaborations, I was discussing Caroline's theater gig with Peter last night at the hospital too. We should plan our meeting next week as well to go over details together.

Caroline: That's great news, Diego! Peter and I are excited about our collaboration on Saturday for my performance. I'm also looking forward to setting up that latte art project with Mei. It'd be awesome if the zine club could join in at the community center.
Diego: Agreed! Let's make sure we all meet up next week to discuss everything and finalize plans for our respective projects. Sounds like a productive week ahead!
