 Andy: Hey Leo, I didn't expect to run into you here at night! Have you finished your gig?

Leo: Hi Andy! Yes, just wrapped up. Heard about our squirrel song mural project, right? I thought Noor's idea of logic puzzles was intriguing.

Andy: Absolutely! It'd be great to collaborate more. How about we discuss it over that coffee you promised me at El Charro tonight?

Leo: Sounds perfect, Andy. Let's make it a double date with Noor and Peter too. Maybe Samantha can join us as well? I think she'd fit in nicely with our creative crew.

Andy: Agreed! Looking forward to our brainstorming session. And let's not forget the yoga session tomorrow morning before we dive into the project, alright?

Leo: Absolutely! Can't wait for a productive and fun-filled day ahead. See you at the park then!
 Mei: Hey Noor, I saw we both ended up here at the museum tonight. Fancy meeting you here!

Noor: Hi Mei! Yes, it seems like fate. So, have you figured out anything about incorporating your squirrel song into the mural project?

Mei: We're actually meeting Leo and Andy for lunch this week at El Charro to brainstorm further. Peter suggested using it for the cat nook too.

Noor: That sounds amazing! I've been emailing with Peter about the project, and we have some exciting collaborations planned this week. How about a quadruple date at El Charro before Tuesday?

Mei: I'd love that! It was great discussing the cat nook design and the surprise event happening at Caroline's cafe on Saturday. And speaking of Caroline, we should definitely work on those logic puzzles for the mural project this weekend as planned.

Noor: Absolutely! We also discussed a field trip to the theater and café for my students. I can't wait to see what we create together. Let's make more memorable times, Mei.

Andy: That sounds fantastic! Let's discuss it further at Idea Central tomorrow. Speaking of which, Diego mentioned a double date this Thursday at Main Street Tacos. You in?

Peter: Absolutely! Count me in for both the collaboration and the double date. Can't wait to see Noor again. And don't forget our yoga session in the park tomorrow morning at 6:00 AM.

Andy: Absolutely, I'll be there! Let's make sure we nail down those puzzles for the mural and bring our squirrel song to life. See you then, Peter.

Peter: Can't wait, Andy. Take care!
