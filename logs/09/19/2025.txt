Caroline is at the restaurant.
Peter is at the park.
Mei is at the home.

Leo is at the hospital.
 Noor: Hey Leo, remember our chat about the mural and the park performance?
Leo: Of course! And it seems we have more collaborators joining in now.

Noor: That's right! Mei suggested involving your zine club in our robotics show, and Peter wants to collaborate on the mural too.
Leo: Exciting times ahead! I also proposed Samantha for our duet at the park tomorrow. What do you think?

Noor: Brilliant idea! Her animal-themed act will make it even more special. Let's hope it rains sunflowers for us, just like in my concept.
Leo: Absolutely, and if luck's on our side, we might even have a symphony of squirrel songs to complement it all.
