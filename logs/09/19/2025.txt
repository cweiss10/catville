Andy is at the train_station.
Samantha is at the gym.
Caroline is at the restaurant.
Peter is at the park.
Mei is at the home.
Diego is at the town_hall.
Noor is at the hospital.
Leo is at the hospital.
 Noor: Hey Leo, remember our chat about the mural and the park performance?
Leo: Of course! And it seems we have more collaborators joining in now.

Noor: That's right! Mei suggested involving your zine club in our robotics show, and Peter wants to collaborate on the mural too.
Leo: Exciting times ahead! I also proposed Samantha for our duet at the park tomorrow. What do you think?

Noor: Brilliant idea! Her animal-themed act will make it even more special. Let's hope it rains sunflowers for us, just like in my concept.
Leo: Absolutely, and if luck's on our side, we might even have a symphony of squirrel songs to complement it all.

 Andy: Hey Samantha! It's great to see you again. I heard about your collaboration with Leo for the park event.

Samantha: Hi Andy. Yes, it should be exciting. I've been working on some ideas for the tech setup. How's the mural project coming along?

Andy: It's going great! We're incorporating your furry friends into the design now, thanks to Leo's squirrel song. We're all thrilled about it.

Samantha: That sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see the final result. Maybe we can grab a cup of tea together at Caroline's Cafe soon and catch up on everything?

Andy: Absolutely! How about tomorrow morning before our meeting at the park? I'll bring my thermos for us both.
 Mei: Hey Noor, I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about our discussions – the collaboration between our groups sounds exciting!

Noor: Absolutely, Mei! I can't wait to see the fusion of our ideas. By the way, I spoke with Diego about your suggestion for a team-building event at Caroline's Café. He thought it was a great idea!

Mei: That's fantastic news! Let's make sure we coordinate schedules and involve both our students as well. We could even set up a regular feeding schedule for the stray cats behind the café.

Noor: I completely agree! And speaking of which, Diego has an interesting idea – incorporating his squirrel song into my robotics project. What do you think?

Mei: That's intriguing! I believe it could add a unique touch to our community gathering. Let's keep discussing and planning so we can make this event truly special for everyone involved.
