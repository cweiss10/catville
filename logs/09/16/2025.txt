Diego is at the park.
Noor is at the park.
Leo is at the theater.
 Andy: Hey Diego, I hope you're feeling better about that knee injury! I was thinking we could start our yoga session earlier in the week, like Tuesday morning?

Diego: That sounds great, Andy! I appreciate your consideration. Let's meet at the park for sunrise then, it'll be a nice change of scenery and inspire some creativity for the mural project too.

Andy: Absolutely! Plus, I think Leo will enjoy an early start. I've also talked to Samantha about joining us with her puzzle ideas and squirrel tunes. She mentioned bringing noise-cancelling headphones if that's okay?

Diego: Of course, Andy! It'll be a fantastic collaboration. Speaking of which, we should probably discuss our cat nook design as well during our meeting. Looking forward to it!
