 Andy: "Hey Noor, I heard about the robotics club helping stray cats. That's awesome! We should do something like that at the community center too."

Noor: "Absolutely, Andy! It's a great way to bring our communities together. Let's plan it soon and maybe collaborate on the mural as well."

Andy: "I'd love that. Speaking of which, have you thought more about incorporating Leo's squirrel song into the mural? I think it could add a unique charm."

Noor: "Yes, I've been mulling it over. Let's discuss it further at El Charro tonight and see how we can make it work."
 Samantha: Hey Caroline, I didn't expect to see you here. We're meeting at El Charro tonight, right?

Caroline: Hi Samantha! Fancy running into you at the library. Yes, our 7 PM rendezvous still stands. But first things first, have you fed those little ones behind the cafe today?

Samantha: Not yet, but I'll make sure to do so before heading over.

Caroline: Wonderful! See you later then, and don't forget about our duet at the library meeting tomorrow.

Samantha: Don't worry, it's already on my schedule. Can't wait for the community event at the park!
