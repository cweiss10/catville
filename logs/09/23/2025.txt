Samantha: Indeed. I've been thinking about Diego's violin improvisations and Leo's bird songs for the park project too. What do you think?

Mei: That would be a beautiful addition! Let's make sure to discuss the cat feeding station at El Charro during our meeting on Thursday.

Samantha: I'd also like to suggest using noise-cancelling headphones during the mural session, if everyone finds it helpful for me. What do you think?

Hey Mei, I managed to get some fantastic sketches for our cat project and even collaborated with Samantha on squirrel tunes!
