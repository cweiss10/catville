 Andy: Hey Mei, I ran into Peter at the café earlier – he's on board with your yoga ideas for our cat mural!

Mei: That's wonderful news, Andy! I also spoke to Caroline about adding music from our students. Have you discussed this with Samantha and Peter?

Andy: Yes, we've been brainstorming at the park and school. We're planning to meet tomorrow afternoon at Caroline's Café to collaborate more on the project.

Mei: That sounds fantastic! Let's make sure to involve Diego's cat designs and the kids from the community center as well. I'd love to see the whole town come together for this.

Andy: Agreed, Mei. Let's keep the tacos idea too – maybe we can save some for the animals! Looking forward to our meeting tomorrow.
 Peter: Hey Diego, heard you're working on that cat mural thing with Mei and gang? How's the knee holding up?

Diego: Hey Peter, yeah, it's coming along! We've been brainstorming ideas and even collaborating with Noor's robotics club and Leo's music. You should join us for street tacos tomorrow at noon, bring those seeds you mentioned too.

Peter: Sounds great, Diego! I can't wait to see how it all comes together. Let's make sure the kids have a fun time too. Maybe we can get them involved somehow.

Diego: Agreed, Peter. The more the merrier! We're even planning a run before the tacos for some good vibes and fresh ideas. See you tomorrow at the park.
