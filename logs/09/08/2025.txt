 Samantha: Hey Leo, I saw your flyer for the park gig last night. Love that improv violin duet with the birds!

Leo: Ah, Samantha! You're quite the observant one. Did you know we might collaborate on a mural project in town? Join us at the community garden this week?

Samantha: That sounds fantastic! I've been brainstorming ideas for Caroline's mural too. Let's synchronize our thoughts, maybe even include the neighborhood strays?

Leo: Absolutely! And don't forget, you mentioned inviting Mei from the train station as well. I'll see you there then!
