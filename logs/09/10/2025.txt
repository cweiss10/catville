 Caroline: Hey Peter, haven't seen you here this late!

Peter: Hey Caroline, I was actually just leaving after running into Diego. We were discussing a community garden project.

Caroline: Oh, cool! I remember you mentioned something about it last week. Did you guys decide on a meeting?

Peter: Yes, we're planning to coordinate ideas before Tuesday and maybe collaborate with your mural project as well.

Caroline: That sounds fantastic! I was just discussing that with Andy and Samantha earlier today. We'd love Noor's involvement too. Maybe we can all meet here at the museum on Tuesday?

Peter: Absolutely, let's make it happen. And who knows, maybe you could perform a set for us after our discussion?

Caroline: You know I'd be happy to! Let's finalize the details over coffee tomorrow after closing. See you then, Peter.

Peter: Sounds great, Caroline. Looking forward to it.
