Caroline: Oh, cool! I remember you mentioned something about it last week. Did you guys decide on a meeting?

Peter: Yes, we're planning to coordinate ideas before Tuesday and maybe collaborate with your mural project as well.

Caroline: That sounds fantastic! I was just discussing that with Andy and Samantha earlier today. We'd love Noor's involvement too. Maybe we can all meet here at the museum on Tuesday?

Peter: Absolutely, let's make it happen. And who knows, maybe you could perform a set for us after our discussion?

Caroline: You know I'd be happy to! Let's finalize the details over coffee tomorrow after closing. See you then, Peter.

Peter: Sounds great, Caroline. Looking forward to it.

Diego: Yes indeed! And Noor is joining us too. We're planning a yoga session here first thing in the morning.

Leo: Great! I can't wait to see what we come up with for that hidden reading nook. I spoke with Caroline about it earlier today, and she seems excited as well.

Diego: Speaking of Caroline, I heard you mentioned a double date with us over the weekend?

Leo: Absolutely! We'll grab coffee before my gig tonight to discuss it further, then meet at our favorite cafe on Saturday for some creative brainstorming and maybe even a yoga session here at the market. Sounds like a plan?

Diego: Agreed! Let's make a difference in this town with our mural project, one street taco at a time.
