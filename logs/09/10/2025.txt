Mei: We did, indeed. I've been discussing it with Diego as well. It seems like we're all on board for collaboration!

Samantha: That's great! Andy suggested a quadruple date at the library this Saturday to plan further. Would you be interested?

Mei: I'd love that, Samantha. I think it could be quite inspiring to have everyone together in one place. How about we also involve the community garden and our neighborhood strays too?

Samantha: That sounds wonderful! Let's make sure they're well taken care of during our planning sessions. I look forward to discussing more this weekend.
 Peter: Hey Leo, didn't expect you at the school this early. Thought you'd still be busking.

Leo: Morning, Peter! Couldn't miss our taco meet. Found some interesting spare parts for the amp. Maybe improvise something special for your show tonight?

Peter: That's great, Leo! I hope it'll add a unique touch to my act. Speaking of which, how's the rehearsal with Caroline going for our squirrel song?

Leo: It's coming along nicely, we're planning to practice more at the park later today. Fancy joining us after dinner? I think you could use some relaxing time amidst nature.

Peter: I'd love that, Leo. Let's catch up then. Maybe we can also discuss Noor's mural design ideas too while we're at it.

Noor: Perfect! How about we discuss it further over coffee before our meeting at the community garden on Thursday?
