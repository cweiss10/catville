 Andy: Hey Mei, I was thinking about our mural project and your zine club's artwork could add some unique flair! What do you think?

Mei: Hi Andy! That sounds lovely! I believe incorporating our zines into the design would indeed create a special touch. Let's collaborate on that!

Andy: Great! How about we meet up at the park tomorrow afternoon to discuss further details and work together?

Mei: That would be wonderful, Andy. See you then! Oh, and I have some seeds for the stray cats in my tote if you need them.

Andy: Thank you so much, Mei! That means a lot. I'll bring Peter's book as a thank-you gift when we meet at Main Street Tacos later today.

Mei: Looking forward to it, Andy. See you soon!
 Caroline: Hey Peter, I didn't expect to see you here so soon! Your usual isn't up just yet, but how about a coffee on me?

Peter: Thanks, Caroline! Good to see you too. You know, I was thinking about our park mural project and I came up with some ideas for yoga fusion elements.

Caroline: That sounds fantastic! I can't wait to see what we come up with together. Let's make sure it feels cozy and inviting like the cafe does.
