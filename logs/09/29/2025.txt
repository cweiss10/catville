 Samantha: Hey Diego, I saw you at the museum last night. Fancy meeting you there!

Diego: Oh hey Samantha! Yes, I was here for a run. How's the mural project coming along?

Samantha: Great! Mei and I are making good progress blending yoga and music. We've even thought about involving Noor's students and perhaps Leo as well. Have you talked to Andy about this yet?

Diego: Yes, we met at Main Street Tacos last night actually. Andy has similar ideas with me, so we plan on discussing the collaboration details there tomorrow. How about we meet up after our separate meetings?

Samantha: That sounds perfect! Let's grab some street tacos and finalize everything together. I have a few updates regarding the cat-inspired poses for the mural too. See you then!
 Caroline: Hey Mei, I can't wait for our squirrel latte art rehearsals at my place!

Mei: Same here, Caroline! I've got some mural sketches ready that I think you'll love. And we should definitely involve Diego's unique cat design, don't you think?

Caroline: Absolutely! Plus, it'd be great to have Leo's performances and Noor's students there too. Speaking of, I spoke to Leo about fixing the amps for our gig at Main Street Tacos.

Mei: That's fantastic! By the way, I had a chat with Samantha yesterday about incorporating her squirrel tunes and Noor's students into the yoga and music segments of our project. She's really excited about it!

Caroline: I'm not surprised! We should definitely brainstorm more at my cafe this week. See you soon!

Mei: Can't wait, Caroline! Let's make magic happen.
