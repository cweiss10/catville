 Diego: Hey Leo, I've been looking forward to our double date with Noor and Caroline! Let's coordinate on that squirrel song for the mural too.

Leo: Absolutely, Diego! I've got some ideas brewing for the amp and park design. Maybe we could even add a yoga corner in the cat nook?

Diego: That sounds like a great idea! Let's catch up more about that at Samantha's spot on Saturday, after feeding stray animals together.

Leo: Agreed, Diego. I also thought we could bring our zine club friends for an impromptu performance at the double date this weekend. How does that sound?

Diego: Brilliant! I can't wait to see how it all comes together. Let's make sure to meet at El Charro before our mural project meeting on Tuesday too, right?

Leo: You got it, Diego. See you then!

Mei: "Great! I can't wait to see everyone come together for art and wellness. By the way, how is your knee feeling after the run this morning?"

Caroline: That sounds perfect, Peter. Let's meet for a bite and then head to the park together. And don't forget about your stylish outfit for our double date this weekend! See you soon!
