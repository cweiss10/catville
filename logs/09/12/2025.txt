Andy: Great to hear that. So, about our quadruple date this weekend, are you ready to try the new taco place on Main Street?

Diego: Absolutely! I heard some good things about it, and I'm looking forward to it. Plus, it's nice to catch up with everyone outside of our usual settings.

Andy: Exactly! It'll be a great way to bring the community together through art and wellness, just like we discussed earlier. Let's make sure we keep each other motivated in our projects too.

Diego: Agreed, Andy. We've always had each other's backs, and it's been instrumental in pushing us forward in our respective fields. Here's to a successful weekend!
