Leo: "You always know just what I need. Looking forward to our squirrel duet at the park tonight. And don't forget our improv session beforehand!"

Caroline: "Absolutely! I can hardly wait. By the way, did you talk with Diego about that double date? We should probably sync our schedules."

Leo: "Oh yes, Sunday it is. Can't wait to jam together and meet your robotics friends. And before all that, let's feed those stray cats."

 Diego: Hey Leo, I've been looking forward to our double date with Noor and Caroline! Let's coordinate on that squirrel song for the mural too.

Leo: Absolutely, Diego! I've got some ideas brewing for the amp and park design. Maybe we could even add a yoga corner in the cat nook?

Diego: That sounds like a great idea! Let's catch up more about that at Samantha's spot on Saturday, after feeding stray animals together.

Leo: Agreed, Diego. I also thought we could bring our zine club friends for an impromptu performance at the double date this weekend. How does that sound?

Diego: Brilliant! I can't wait to see how it all comes together. Let's make sure to meet at El Charro before our mural project meeting on Tuesday too, right?

Leo: You got it, Diego. See you then!
