 Samantha: Hey Caroline, I'm glad we could collaborate on this mural project. Your latte art will make it truly special!

Caroline: Absolutely, Samantha! And I can't wait to see how the stray cats react to our symphony of colors and music! Let's make sure to invite Leo too, he'll bring his violin.

Samantha: That sounds perfect. I'll bring chamomile tea for them as well. Maybe we can meet under the old oak tree this afternoon, just like you suggested?

Caroline: Sounds great! I'll see you there around 3:00 PM then. And don't worry about the small talk, just remember to enjoy our shared passion for making a difference.
