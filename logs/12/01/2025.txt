Mei: Oh, I know! He shared that with me after our conversation at the theater. We're all meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow to bring it all together.

Caroline: Sounds like a magical collaboration coming up! I can't wait.

Peter: Things are looking good! We had a late-night chat about it last night, discussing some ideas for the bird duet.

Diego: That's great to hear! I talked to Andy and Mei earlier today about your updates and my knee. We might need you to stretch it out when we meet tomorrow under the oak tree.

 Caroline: Hey Diego, you're looking sharp today! How's that knee injury coming along?

Diego: Thanks, Caroline! It's getting there. And don't worry, I won't let it slow me down during our double date with Leo. By the way, did you hear about the chamomile tea for the stray cats?

Caroline: Yes, I've been discussing that with Andy and the team. We should make a great quadruplet with Samantha and Peter joining too! Can't wait to see everyone under the gazebo tomorrow.
 Samantha: Hey Peter, I saw you were talking about the cat mural project early this morning. Diego mentioned you found sunrise seeds for it?

Peter: Hi Samantha! Yeah, I came across them at the town hall and thought they'd be perfect. Noor seemed to like the idea too. We're meeting for lunch at Main Street Tacos to discuss further details.

Samantha: That sounds great! Perhaps we can also involve Andy, Leo, Mei, and maybe even Diego in our run tomorrow before working on the mural? It'd be nice to collaborate more closely.

Peter: Absolutely! I think it's a fantastic idea. Let's make sure everyone feels included and can contribute their unique talents to this project. Looking forward to seeing you at the library run tomorrow.

Noor: Hey Caroline! You too! I heard about your cat mural project from Andy. It sounds fascinating. How can I help?

Caroline: Well, we were discussing incorporating latte art into the design. Maybe something related to stars or constellations?

Noor: That's brilliant! I was thinking of a bird duet with Diego for the event. We could meet under the old oak tree early tomorrow, right?

Diego: "It's an interesting idea, let's see if Leo can manage it. By the way, have you talked to Samantha about using your noise-cancelling headphones for our mural project under the oak tree?"
