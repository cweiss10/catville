Peter: Sounds great! I also mentioned our double date with Diego for tomorrow, and he's bringing chamomile for the stray cats. We could all collaborate there and maybe create something extraordinary.

Leo: Absolutely, let's not forget Andy is inviting everyone involved to meet under the gazebo the day after as well. And Noor suggested joining us at the oak tree too. This is going to be one hell of a creative session!

Andy: I couldn't agree more. Let's make sure we meet under the old oak tree bright and early tomorrow to get started.

Caroline: Absolutely, Andy! I'll bring my violin and let's create something beautiful together for our town. See you then!

Peter: Things are looking good! We had a late-night chat about it last night, discussing some ideas for the bird duet.

Diego: That's great to hear! I talked to Andy and Mei earlier today about your updates and my knee. We might need you to stretch it out when we meet tomorrow under the oak tree.

Diego: Absolutely! See you then, and maybe we can grab some street tacos from Main Street Tacos afterwards.
