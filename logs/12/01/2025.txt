 Andy: Hey Leo, just saw your twigs and leaves – looks like you're getting ready for our meeting under the old oak tomorrow?

Leo: Absolutely, Andy! Can't wait to share my ideas about sunrise seeds and improvised instruments. And don't forget about chamomile for the stray cats.

Andy: You've got a deal! Looking forward to our bird duet too. By the way, Diego's keen on joining as well. Maybe we can invite Caroline and more folks under that gazebo soon?

Leo: Sounds fantastic, Andy. I'll let Peter know about it. Let's keep this collaboration going – it feels like something truly magical is happening here.
