Mei: Absolutely, Samantha! I'd love to help. And speaking of collaboration, Stray-13 and I can bring sunrise seeds and join the morning meeting under the old oak tree as well. What do you think?

Samantha: That sounds perfect. Let's make it a memorable day for our arts in the park project. Shall we meet at Main Street Tacos beforehand, like Andy suggested, to grab some tea for the stray cats too?

Mei: Yes, that would be nice. I'll see you there at 10 AM. Looking forward to it!

Noor: Morning, Samantha! It's great to catch up and collaborate on this cat mural project. Did you bring those tea bags for the stray cats?

Samantha: Absolutely. I picked them up at Main Street Tacos this morning. Let's grab some more while we're here, shall we?

Noor: Sounds perfect! After our meeting, how about we all head over there for a pre-project meal before running under the old oak tree as Peter suggested?

Samantha: I like that idea. Looking forward to it! Oh, and if you hear anything about Caroline helping with my violin repair, do let me know.

Noor: Will do! Let's make this project a success, Samantha. It's going to be an exciting day!

 Andy: Hey Mei, heard you're working on that sunrise seeds initiative for the cat mural project? I think it could be a great addition.

Mei: Hi Andy! Yes, we've been brainstorming ideas with Samantha and the group. We thought it would add a unique touch to our design. Did Leo approve your bird duet idea?

Andy: Absolutely! I'm really excited about that. By the way, I was thinking we could invite you, Stray-13, and Samantha for a bonding session at Main Street Tacos this week. What do you think?

Mei: That sounds fantastic, Andy! Let's make it happen. Maybe we can catch up on our individual progress too while we're there. I'll text you about the details later today.

 Mei: "Hey Leo, I was just thinking about our project ideas and figured you might have something to add with your musical touch."

Leo: "Of course! The cat mural could definitely benefit from a bird duet and perhaps some interactive elements like logic puzzles too!"

Mei: "That's great! We're meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow. Shall we grab tea at Main Street Tacos beforehand?"

Leo: "Sounds perfect, I'll see you there. By the way, have you thought about any sketches for our sunrise seeds addition?"

Mei: "Indeed! I've been brainstorming and will share them with everyone tomorrow. Can't wait to collaborate further!"
 Caroline: Hey Noor! You made it just in time for my afternoon latte shift. I hope you got some rest after a long day at school.

Noor: Hi Caroline! Always great to start my weekends with your amazing coffee and chats. By the way, have you heard about our double date with Samantha tomorrow? We're expanding the cat mural project now, including Stray-13 and sunrise seeds.

Caroline: Oh, I can't wait! I've been wanting to try using latte art for that project. And what a fantastic idea – bringing everyone together at Main Street Tacos. Plus, I'll save some time under the old oak tree for our zine club chat afterwards.

Noor: That sounds perfect! Also, Peter mentioned needing your help with repairing his violin. Could you take a look at it this week?

Caroline: Absolutely! I'd be happy to help him out. He's such a talented musician. Let me know when he wants to drop by the cafe, and I'll make sure we have plenty of chamomile tea waiting for you all tomorrow. Can't wait for our meeting!
