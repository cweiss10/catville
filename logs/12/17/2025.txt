 Samantha: Hey Mei, I've been thinking about our cat mural project. Would you be interested in collaborating on a logic puzzle for it?

Mei: Absolutely, Samantha! I'd love to help. And speaking of collaboration, Stray-13 and I can bring sunrise seeds and join the morning meeting under the old oak tree as well. What do you think?

Samantha: That sounds perfect. Let's make it a memorable day for our arts in the park project. Shall we meet at Main Street Tacos beforehand, like Andy suggested, to grab some tea for the stray cats too?

Mei: Yes, that would be nice. I'll see you there at 10 AM. Looking forward to it!
