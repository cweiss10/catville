 Samantha: Hey Diego, I managed to set up the watering system for the strays. Thanks for your help with the rhythm algorithm.

Diego: No problem, Samantha! I saw Luna behind Caroline's Café today, she looks a bit hungry. We should make sure she's taken care of. And, by the way, I've got some ideas for that cat mural we're working on together. Let's meet at the library tomorrow night?

Samantha: Sounds good, Diego. See you there at 7 PM sharp. Looking forward to our collaboration.
