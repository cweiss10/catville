Noor: I love it! Let's make it an experiment. I'll bring some snacks for energy. It's perfect since we're trying to keep our students healthy too.

Peter: Agreed. Plus, it's a great opportunity for the community to come together. Did you talk to Mei about the sunrise seeds? We can't forget those!

Diego: Thanks for asking, Peter. Slowly but surely. I've been stretching and sticking to my street taco diet to keep my energy levels high. Let's catch up more about the projects after our run tomorrow.
