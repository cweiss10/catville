 Andy: Hey Noor, I heard about your cat mural project at the museum. Looks like we share a common passion for our feline friends!

Noor: Hi Andy! Indeed, it's great to collaborate with someone who appreciates the art of felines as much as I do. And it seems we have Caroline and Samantha joining us too. Exciting times ahead!

Andy: Absolutely! Let's make sure to include Stray-13 in our plans. We should also discuss having chamomile tea for the strays at our pre-event gathering under the old oak tree. What do you think?

Noor: That sounds wonderful, Andy. I was thinking about bringing some snacks for the students too. And I'd be more than happy to serenade everyone with my violin before we head to your place for oolong tea. Shall we finalize plans tomorrow at 3 PM under the old oak tree?

Andy: Agreed! See you there, Noor. Can't wait to create some beautiful memories together in our town.
 Samantha: "Hey Mei, I found some kittens at the park, could use extra cat food tonight?"

Mei: "Absolutely, meet me under the old oak tree after sunset with oolong tea and we'll discuss automating their water."

(Later)

Mei: "Samantha, I've been thinking about your rhythm-based algorithm for our music project. Let's run together tomorrow morning?"

Samantha: "Sounds great! Diego will join us too. Meet you under the old oak tree with chamomile tea."

--- 2:00 AM ---
Andy is at the cafe.
Samantha is at the hospital.
Caroline is at the gym.
Peter is at the hospital.
Mei is at the park.
Diego is at the gym.
Leo is at the museum.
 Samantha: "Hey Peter, I brought some cat food for Stray-13 like we discussed. I hope they enjoy it."

Peter: "Great! And I've got some chamomile for the kitties. Thanks for setting this up under the oak tree – it's perfect for our creative gathering."

Samantha: "Of course, I think everyone will find something interesting here tonight. Looking forward to Leo's violin performance and your watering system ideas in our mural project."

Peter: "Same here! And don't forget, we're meeting with Caroline and Diego at Main Street Tacos this weekend. Should be fun!"

Samantha: "Excited for that too. I'm curious about who the surprise guest is for tomorrow's meeting – hope it adds a nice twist."
 Caroline: Hey Diego, didn't expect to see you here so late! I thought you'd be at home stretching or something.

Diego: Hey Caroline! Not often I can get a run in this late without bumping into clients. How about you? Still pouring lattes or serenading the theater crowd?

Caroline: A bit of both, actually. I came here for a quick workout before heading to Andy's place for some oolong tea and planning our event at the park together. You should come, if you're not too busy with your knee rehab.

Diego: Sounds like fun! I could use a break from my usual routine. Maybe we can catch up on all things Caroline and Diego once I get my knee sorted out. How's Stray-13 doing for the mural event?

Caroline: Andy mentioned including him in Samantha's project at the lake, but we haven't confirmed his participation yet. We're also planning a violin serenade by Noor for our pre-event gathering. Do you know if she'll be at the café today?

Diego: I think I saw her chatting with Mei at the town hall earlier, so it's possible she might drop by the café later. I'll let her know about our meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow. Speaking of food, have you tried those cat food samples I recommended? Andy seemed quite interested in them for Stray-13.

Caroline: Absolutely! They seem like a great option for him. I think he's going to love them. Thanks for suggesting it. See you later then, Diego! Take care of that knee!

Diego: You too, Caroline! Looking forward to our catch-up. And don't worry about the knee, I'll be fine. See you tomorrow!
