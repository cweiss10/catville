 Andy: Hey Noor, I heard about your cat mural project at the museum. Looks like we share a common passion for our feline friends!

Noor: Hi Andy! Indeed, it's great to collaborate with someone who appreciates the art of felines as much as I do. And it seems we have Caroline and Samantha joining us too. Exciting times ahead!

Andy: Absolutely! Let's make sure to include Stray-13 in our plans. We should also discuss having chamomile tea for the strays at our pre-event gathering under the old oak tree. What do you think?

Noor: That sounds wonderful, Andy. I was thinking about bringing some snacks for the students too. And I'd be more than happy to serenade everyone with my violin before we head to your place for oolong tea. Shall we finalize plans tomorrow at 3 PM under the old oak tree?

Andy: Agreed! See you there, Noor. Can't wait to create some beautiful memories together in our town.
 Samantha: "Hey Mei, I found some kittens at the park, could use extra cat food tonight?"

Mei: "Absolutely, meet me under the old oak tree after sunset with oolong tea and we'll discuss automating their water."

(Later)

Mei: "Samantha, I've been thinking about your rhythm-based algorithm for our music project. Let's run together tomorrow morning?"

Samantha: "Sounds great! Diego will join us too. Meet you under the old oak tree with chamomile tea."
