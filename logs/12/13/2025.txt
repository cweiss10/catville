Noor: "Thanks Caroline! I'm excited for that, and I hear Leo had a hospital visit. Hope he's feeling better soon. We should discuss the double date plans under the old oak tree this weekend."

Caroline: "Absolutely, let's make sure we all gather there at 6 PM sharp to finalize the mural plans, and I'll bring Diego along too for his input. How about you invite Peter as well?"
 Samantha: Hey Mei, I saw you were at the library earlier. Did you manage to find some quiet time amidst all the buzz?

Mei: Hello Samantha! Yes, thank you for asking. The afternoon was peaceful, just as I like it. I even found a new zine on local artists that I think you'd appreciate.

Samantha: That sounds wonderful, Mei. I look forward to checking it out. By the way, did we decide on a date for our double date with Noor and the others?

Mei: Indeed! We're meeting at the old oak tree tomorrow evening. Leo suggested serving chamomile tea for the stray cats during our meetings there, don't you think it's a lovely idea?

Samantha: It is, Mei. I've been meaning to ask – have you collected those sunrise seeds from Diego like we discussed with Noor? I'd love to use them in our cat mural project.

Mei: Yes, I did! I saved some for the zine club too. It feels wonderful to collaborate on these projects and bring art and community together in such a tangible way.

 Caroline: "Hey Diego, heard you're working on some logic puzzles for our cat mural? I think they'd be a great addition!"

Diego: "Absolutely! Peter had the idea too. And I've been discussing it with Andy. We should have a fun design going soon."

Caroline: "That sounds wonderful! Let's meet under the old oak tree this weekend to finalize the details, and I'll bring chamomile tea for Leo."

Diego: "Sounds perfect! Don't forget our double date before that with a sunrise run? And I'll bring some street tacos as a thank you for Andy's help with puzzles."

Caroline: "I can't wait! It's going to be an amazing project. See you then, Diego!"

Diego: "Take care, Caroline. Can't wait to see the progress we make together."
 Peter: Hey Noor, I spoke with Leo about our cat mural project and we're making some exciting changes! He suggested adding chamomile tea for the strays, and even offered to make it himself.

Noor: That sounds wonderful, Peter! I'm glad he agreed. It's such a thoughtful touch, and I can't wait to see how it turns out. By the way, I had a great time discussing ideas with Samantha and Caroline today. They seem really passionate about this project too.

Peter: Oh, I heard! They're awesome additions to our team. I also invited Leo to rehearse under the old oak tree tomorrow morning before our meeting. He said he'd bring his knee chamomile tea for us all to try. Hopefully we can convince Diego to join as well.

Noor: That sounds like a perfect plan! Let's make this day special, Peter. I think it'll really bring everyone together and inspire our work on the mural. See you there tomorrow.

Peter: Absolutely, Noor. Looking forward to it.
