Andy is at the restaurant.
Samantha is at the market.
Caroline is at the park.
Peter is at the cafe.
Diego is at the market.
Noor is at the park.
Leo is at the library.
 Caroline: "Hey Noor, your sunrise seeds will look lovely in our mural, did you know Leo's been practicing his violin for that too? Can't wait to see it all come together."

Noor: "Thanks Caroline! I'm excited for that, and I hear Leo had a hospital visit. Hope he's feeling better soon. We should discuss the double date plans under the old oak tree this weekend."

Caroline: "Absolutely, let's make sure we all gather there at 6 PM sharp to finalize the mural plans, and I'll bring Diego along too for his input. How about you invite Peter as well?"
 Samantha: Hey Mei, I saw you were at the library earlier. Did you manage to find some quiet time amidst all the buzz?

Mei: Hello Samantha! Yes, thank you for asking. The afternoon was peaceful, just as I like it. I even found a new zine on local artists that I think you'd appreciate.

Samantha: That sounds wonderful, Mei. I look forward to checking it out. By the way, did we decide on a date for our double date with Noor and the others?

Mei: Indeed! We're meeting at the old oak tree tomorrow evening. Leo suggested serving chamomile tea for the stray cats during our meetings there, don't you think it's a lovely idea?

Samantha: It is, Mei. I've been meaning to ask – have you collected those sunrise seeds from Diego like we discussed with Noor? I'd love to use them in our cat mural project.

Mei: Yes, I did! I saved some for the zine club too. It feels wonderful to collaborate on these projects and bring art and community together in such a tangible way.
