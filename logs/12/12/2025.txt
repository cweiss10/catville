Caroline: Absolutely! And speaking of everyone, Leo wants to collaborate more on this. He even thought of treating the stray cats with some tacos after the meeting.

Mei: That's wonderful! We should also discuss the community garden with Noor tonight over dinner, as you suggested at the library. Small rituals make our town stronger.

Samantha: Yes, he mentioned it when we talked at school. It could be an interesting addition, especially if we can find a way to make it blend seamlessly with the rest of the design. Maybe we can rehearse under the old oak tree once it's integrated?

Noor: Absolutely! I think the bird duets under that tree would provide the perfect ambiance for our collaboration. Let's invite Leo, Diego, and perhaps even Peter and his pet for a double date there soon. What do you think?

Samantha: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Noor. Let's make it happen. And maybe we could even serve chamomile tea for the stray cats during our meeting under that oak tree as a tradition, as Leo suggested.
