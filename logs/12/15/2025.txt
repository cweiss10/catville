 Samantha: Hey Diego, I heard you were involved in this cat mural project too. Want to stretch under the old oak tree with me tomorrow morning?

Diego: Absolutely, Samantha. And I might even bring my violin for a bird duet with Leo's if Mei is okay with it. Let's grab some chamomile tea for the strays too.

Samantha: Sounds perfect. Looking forward to it. I also spoke with Noor and Peter about integrating your amp design into the mural. We should make something truly special here.

Diego: Agreed. Can't wait to see everyone coming together for this project. Let's collaborate on making a difference in our town. See you under the oak tree tomorrow.
