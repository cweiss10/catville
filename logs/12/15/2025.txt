Caroline: That's fantastic news! I can't wait for the final result. Mei from the hospital might be able to help with the constellation ideas, you know. Shall we arrange a meeting about it by the cozy corner at 10 AM?

Andy: Absolutely! Let's make sure to bring our sketches and look forward to our collaboration. Thanks for connecting us, Caroline. You really are the gossip filter that connects people gently.

Caroline: Aww, Andy, it's always a pleasure working with you on projects like these. Let's keep the creative juices flowing! I'll see you at 10 AM by the cozy corner.

 Andy: Hey Noor, I heard about your cat mural project. Sounds exciting!

Noor: Thanks, Andy! I was thinking we could incorporate our shared love for sunrises somehow. What do you think?

Andy: That sounds perfect! I've been sketching some ideas and would love to collaborate more.

Noor: I agree! Let's meet up this weekend to brainstorm, maybe at the park where we sketched together last month?

Andy: Sounds great! How about we bring Leo and Peter too, they'd be excited to contribute as well.

Noor: That's a fantastic idea! I'll text them now. See you then, Andy.

Andy: Looking forward to it, Noor. Let's create something special together!
