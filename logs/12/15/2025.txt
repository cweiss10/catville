Samantha: Sounds perfect. Looking forward to it. I also spoke with Noor and Peter about integrating your amp design into the mural. We should make something truly special here.

Diego: Agreed. Can't wait to see everyone coming together for this project. Let's collaborate on making a difference in our town. See you under the oak tree tomorrow.

 Andy: Hey Caroline, I ran into Leo at the cafe last night and we discussed collaborating on the cat mural project!

Caroline: Oh, that sounds wonderful, Andy! Did you two talk about incorporating bird duets like we planned?

Andy: Yes, we did! Leo even mentioned having spare parts to fix Peter's old violin. We're planning to rehearse under the old oak tree tomorrow and gather at the theater once finished.

Caroline: That's fantastic news! I can't wait for the final result. Mei from the hospital might be able to help with the constellation ideas, you know. Shall we arrange a meeting about it by the cozy corner at 10 AM?

Andy: Absolutely! Let's make sure to bring our sketches and look forward to our collaboration. Thanks for connecting us, Caroline. You really are the gossip filter that connects people gently.

Caroline: Aww, Andy, it's always a pleasure working with you on projects like these. Let's keep the creative juices flowing! I'll see you at 10 AM by the cozy corner.
