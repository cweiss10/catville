 Peter: Hey Leo, nice to see you here at the town hall. I heard your violin playing in the park earlier, it was beautiful.

Leo: Hello Peter, thanks! You're quite the regular at the park too, aren't you? I remember our jam sessions with Stray-13. How about a duet here tonight under the old oak tree, before everyone else arrives?

Peter: Absolutely, I'd love that. Let's make some music together, old friend. And maybe we can discuss this cat mural project while we're at it.

Peter: Awesome! Don't forget to bring those cat food samples too. Can't wait to see Noor play her violin there.

Diego: Absolutely, I have everything sorted. By the way, I met with Noor yesterday at the town hall to discuss our plans further. We're also thinking about setting up an automated watering system for strays, one step at a time.

Diego: You got it, Peter. Looking forward to seeing you both tomorrow under the oak tree.

Caroline: Oh absolutely! Andy and Diego are super excited, and we're even collaborating with Samantha from Main Street Tacos for an artistic performance featuring Stray-13.

Mei: That sounds wonderful, and I have a surprise guest for my gathering tomorrow as well. We should catch up more about these projects under the old oak tree, right?

Caroline: Definitely! Let's make sure to grab some chamomile tea for the stray cats from Peter too, shall we? It would be perfect for our community garden.
