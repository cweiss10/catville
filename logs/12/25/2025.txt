Peter: Absolutely, I'd love that. Let's make some music together, old friend. And maybe we can discuss this cat mural project while we're at it.

Peter: Awesome! Don't forget to bring those cat food samples too. Can't wait to see Noor play her violin there.

Peter: Great idea! I've always thought Noor would fit in well with our little group. Let's make sure the café stays cozy amidst all this creativity. Plus, I could use a friendly face to help with the ego sometimes.

Caroline: (laughing) Well, you're certainly learning! See you at the café then. And don't forget about our practice session under the oak tree tomorrow.

Peter: Absolutely! Can't wait for that. Thanks for all your help, Caroline. You really are a treasure around here.
