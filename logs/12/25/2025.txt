 Diego: Hey Noor, looks like we're both here under the old oak tree at midnight, ready for our meeting. I brought the cat food samples and my stretching mat.

Noor: Hi Diego! Perfect timing. And I have some chamomile tea for our furry friends. Let's settle down, discuss our plans over street tacos, just like we planned at the town hall. We've got a beautiful collaboration ahead.
 Peter: Hey Leo, nice to see you here at the town hall. I heard your violin playing in the park earlier, it was beautiful.

Leo: Hello Peter, thanks! You're quite the regular at the park too, aren't you? I remember our jam sessions with Stray-13. How about a duet here tonight under the old oak tree, before everyone else arrives?

Peter: Absolutely, I'd love that. Let's make some music together, old friend. And maybe we can discuss this cat mural project while we're at it.
