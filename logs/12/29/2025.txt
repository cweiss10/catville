 Peter: Hey Noor, I heard about your gathering under the old oak tree tomorrow. Sounds like a great idea! I'd love to collaborate on our cat mural too.

Noor: That's awesome, Peter! I was hoping you could bring some of your startup network and ideas for funding. Plus, I've been wanting to discuss automating the watering system with you. Let's make it happen!

Peter: Absolutely, Noor! I'll even bring street tacos as a thank-you for letting us use Caroline's garden. What time should we meet?

Noor: How about we gather around 3:30 PM? That gives everyone enough time to prepare and join in. Looking forward to it, Peter!
