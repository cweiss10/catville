 Peter: Hey Noor, I heard about your gathering under the old oak tree tomorrow. Sounds like a great idea! I'd love to collaborate on our cat mural too.

Noor: That's awesome, Peter! I was hoping you could bring some of your startup network and ideas for funding. Plus, I've been wanting to discuss automating the watering system with you. Let's make it happen!

Peter: Absolutely, Noor! I'll even bring street tacos as a thank-you for letting us use Caroline's garden. What time should we meet?

Noor: How about we gather around 3:30 PM? That gives everyone enough time to prepare and join in. Looking forward to it, Peter!

Leo is at the town_hall.
 Mei: Hey Diego, I hope your knee's feeling better after our chat at Caroline's. I've been thinking about that collaborative performance we discussed for the museum.

Diego: Good to hear from you, Mei! My knee's improving, thanks. I was just discussing our mural project with Noor under our old oak tree. Have you made any progress on your part?

Mei: Yes, I've got Leo on board for his bird music, and we'll discuss the details over lattes as Peter suggested. I believe it could be something truly magical under that oak tree.

Diego: That sounds fantastic! I'm excited to see how it all comes together. Let's make sure to involve Samantha's new chamomile tea for the stray cats too, and maybe we can work on some latte art ideas during our catch-up at Caroline's.
 Andy: Hey Noor, thanks for joining me under the old oak tree today. I've been thinking about your rhythm algorithms for my mural, and I think they'd be perfect for Stray-13 too!

Noor: Absolutely, Andy! I brought some headphones for you to experiment with them. And I brewed some chamomile tea for the stray cats here as well. Let's make this project unique and special together.

Diego's tacos really help us think creatively, don't they? Looking forward to our sunset music event!

 Caroline: "Mei, you're just in time for a latte! I saved one of your usuals."

Mei: "Ah, Caroline, thanks! Your cozy vibe always feels like home. How is the cat mural project coming along?"

Caroline: "It's going great! Samantha and I discussed our plans for Stray-13 over some chamomile yesterday. We thought about Diego joining us with his violin under that old oak tree."

Mei: "That sounds lovely! Perhaps he can even play during our zine club meeting? It would be a wonderful addition."

Caroline: "I'll propose it to him, I'm sure he'd love the idea. Looking forward to seeing you both there tomorrow."
 Andy: Hey Samantha, I saw you at the library yesterday. We should collaborate on that cat mural project with Caroline!

Samantha: Hi Andy, yes, let's work together! I have some ideas for the AI element you mentioned earlier. Maybe we can incorporate rhythm algorithms too?

Andy: Absolutely! Noor suggested it as well. Let's meet under the old oak tree tomorrow at 3 PM with chamomile tea for the strays, just like old times.

Samantha: Sounds great, Andy. I'll bring my noise-cancelling headphones for focus, but let's try to avoid creative block!

Andy: Of course, Samantha. Looking forward to our collaboration. Peter and Mei are excited too!
