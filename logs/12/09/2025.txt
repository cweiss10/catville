 Andy: Hey Samantha, how about that chamomile tea under the old oak tomorrow? Mei suggested constellations for the mural, and I think it could be a great start.

Samantha: Sounds good, Andy. Looking forward to working together on the cat mural project. By the way, I've been thinking about those logic puzzles we discussed, and I could use your help with them tomorrow at the cafe if you're up for it?

Peter: Count me in! Let's make it a double date with Noor and Leo. How about an early morning run before we dive into our work?

Andy: Perfect! I'll bring my sketchbook, and Peter, don't forget the treats for the stray cats. See you both then.
 Diego: Hey Leo, you're earlier than usual. Heard about your collaboration with Noor?

Leo: Ah, Diego! Morning runs have become quite regular for me lately. Yes, we're turning the cat mural into a musical affair. Excited to practice under the old oak tree this weekend.

Diego: Sounds fantastic! Mei and I will join you too. We're planning a taco dinner on Thursday, with Peter joining us as well. Maybe our street tacos can inspire some of your improvised notes.

Leo: That's perfect timing! Looking forward to it. And Diego, don't forget to bring chamomile tea for the cats.

Diego: Absolutely! I wouldn't dream of leaving them out. Now let's get moving, we have a run to finish before our taco date tomorrow.
