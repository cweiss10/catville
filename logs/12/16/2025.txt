Diego is at the museum.
Noor is at the market.
Leo is at the town_hall.
 Samantha: Hey Leo, I hope you enjoyed that impromptu duet with Diego's violin yesterday.

Leo: Indeed, Samantha! It was a delightful surprise. Did you manage to get the chamomile tea for the stray cats?

Samantha: Almost done. I'll leave it for them tonight behind the cafe as usual.

Leo: Perfect! Speaking of surprises, have you thought about that garden collaboration we discussed? We could use your programming skills to automate some watering systems.

Samantha: That sounds intriguing, Leo. I'd be happy to help with the garden and explore how technology can improve it. Let's discuss more at our usual spot under the old oak tree tomorrow morning.

 Samantha: Hey Diego, I overheard you discussing sunrise seeds for the garden with Mei. Noor mentioned something about that too.

Diego: Ah, yes! It seems like we're all on the same page then. Let's make sure to discuss how to incorporate them into our designs under the old oak tree this evening, shall we?

Samantha: Absolutely! I also suggested involving Leo and his violin for the event. Maybe you could bring your own as well for a bird duet?

Diego: That sounds lovely! I'll make sure to practice my scales before then. Have you also spoken with Noor about the amp design for Stray-13?

Samantha: Yes, we're meeting tomorrow under that old oak tree to finalize it. I'll bring my headphones and some chamomile tea for everyone. Looking forward to it!
