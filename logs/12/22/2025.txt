 Samantha: Hey Diego, I noticed your early runs. Would you like to join me for my sunset music project at the lake tomorrow? I'm inviting Peter too, he plays violin.

Diego: Good morning, Samantha! That sounds interesting. I'd love to help out with that and catch up. Peter is a regular at my gym, isn't he? We could use his musical talents for sure. Plus, I've been thinking we should involve Stray-13 in our project.

Samantha: Yes, that's the plan! Peter mentioned it to me as well. Let's make sure to have plenty of cat treats ready for him too.

Diego: Agreed! And speaking of which, I brought some samples for Andy earlier. He reminded me about our evening meeting at the park to work on the automated watering system. You might want to join us if you're free. We could also have tea for Stray-13 and his friends.

Samantha: That sounds like a good idea! I'll see you both there then. Take care of your knee, Diego.

Diego: Will do, Samantha. You too. Let's make tomorrow count!
