Diego: That sounds like a great idea! I can't wait to see how the mural turns out. By the way, Caroline is eager to join us and bring her ideas for Leo's amp under the old oak tree tomorrow. How does that sound?

Noor: That's wonderful news! Caroline's creativity will really enhance our project. And I heard Peter suggested a rehearsal for Leo under the oak tree before our meeting. He wanted to make it special and bring everyone closer together. How about we make it a double date at Main Street Tacos?

Caroline: Can't wait, Mei! It'll be great to catch up and discuss everything with everyone involved. And I'm excited to show off my latte art skills at the event too!
