 Andy: "Hey Caroline, love your latte art today - reminds me of those harmonious notes you hit on stage."

Caroline: "Thanks, Andy! I was thinking about our mural project again, and wanted to discuss some ideas over chamomile tea before the unveiling under the old oak tree."

Andy: "That sounds perfect! I'll bring the tea and sunrise seeds for the design. Let's also invite Peter and Diego - Noor suggested they'd have great input."

Caroline: "Absolutely! And we should ask Mei and maybe Samantha too, to make it a full community effort. I'll send a message later today."
