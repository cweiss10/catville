 Andy: Hey Mei, I thought your logic puzzle was brilliant for the mural project!

Mei: Thank you, Andy. I'm glad you like it. By the way, have you tried automating our garden watering system with sunrise seeds?

Andy: Not yet, but it sounds intriguing. I'll definitely give it a shot after we finalize the mural sketches.

Mei: Great! I believe it could really bring some life into our town. Let's collaborate on that soon too.
