 Caroline: Hey Leo, I heard about your bird duet idea for the cat mural project – that sounds amazing!

Leo: Hi Caroline! Yeah, I can't wait to see everyone gather under the old oak tree tomorrow. I hope you'll join us too. And thanks for taking care of the cozy vibe at the cafe while I'm away.

Caroline: Of course, Leo! I wouldn't miss it for the world. Plus, I've got some exciting secret garden stories to share with Andy during our coffee catch-up tomorrow. Maybe you can join as well?

Leo: That sounds fantastic, Caroline. Count me in! Let's make sure we arrive early so we don't miss the bird duet or Peter's chamomile for the strays.
