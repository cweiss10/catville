Andy: It's coming along nicely. I was discussing some rhythm-based algorithm ideas with Mei and Noor yesterday. We thought your fitness background could add an interesting perspective.
Diego: Sounds intriguing! Let's make it happen, Andy. By the way, I brought the parts for the watering system we discussed earlier.

Andy: That's fantastic, Diego. I'm looking forward to our collaboration under the old oak tree tomorrow. By the way, have you invited Samantha yet?
