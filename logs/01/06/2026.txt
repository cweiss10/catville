Peter: Absolutely! I think it'll add a unique touch. Speaking of Diego, did you get his latte art idea under the old oak tree tonight like we planned?

Andy: Not yet, but I will. And thanks for reminding me about that. By the way, I spoke with Mei at the museum today and she recommended noise-cancelling headphones for our event at Noor's.

Peter: That sounds practical! I also had a chat with Samantha offering her help with pattern work for our mural design. I suggested we meet over coffee tomorrow to discuss further details.

Andy: Sounds perfect. Let's make sure we save some creativity for our creative session at Caroline's Café tonight. And don't forget, Mei promised to bring cat food for Stray-13!

Peter: Right on that too! I'll grab the chamomile seeds from my garden and see you soon, Andy.
