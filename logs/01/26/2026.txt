 Andy: Hey Samantha! I didn't expect to see you here so early. Looks like we're both starting our days off right.

Samantha: Hello, Andy. You seemed quite focused on your sketches earlier at the park. Your sunrise piece looks stunning as always.

Andy: Thanks, Samantha! I appreciate your kind words. By the way, have you thought more about those city night sounds for our cat mural?

Samantha: Yes, I've been working on a few ideas. I think we can incorporate them seamlessly into Diego's mechanical birds designs. Let's discuss further tomorrow during our session under the oak tree.

Andy: Perfect! And perhaps Peter can join us with his bird duet as well? That would be amazing.

Samantha: Agreed. It will make for a truly unique collaborative piece. See you in the morning, Andy.

Andy: You too, Samantha. Don't forget about our workout beforehand! Let's get moving together.

Peter: "Absolutely, Andy! I've also been brainstorming some city night sounds for our tea party under the oak tree. Let's collaborate and make it a great night!"

(Both laugh)
