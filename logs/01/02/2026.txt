Noor is at the cafe.
 Mei: "Hey Noor, I hope you've been well. I was thinking about those chamomile teas we discussed for the robotics club meeting - have you picked up any yet?"

Noor: "Absolutely! I got some this morning from Caroline's. I also spoke to Peter about collaborating on latte art for our gathering under the old oak tree. We could have a violin duet, what do you think?"

Mei: "That sounds delightful! I'm bringing seedlings for the community garden as well, we can share tips during our discussions."

Noor: "Great idea! Let's make sure we feed Stray-13 before the gathering too. See you later at Caroline's then?"

Mei: "Looking forward to it!"
 Caroline: "Hey Peter, did you work on that violin design for our mural yet? I heard Leo's excited about it."

Peter: "Not just yet, but I finished a beautiful latte art swan this morning. Thought it might inspire the music for our collaboration."

Caroline: "You know, your latte art has come a long way since our gym mornings. And speaking of collaborations, Leo mentioned some new tea blend ideas from Diego."

Peter: "I'd love to hear about those. Maybe we could bring them to life at the café event, just like our shared coffee blends."

Caroline: "Absolutely! Let's make this project something magical for everyone, especially Luna and Stray-13."

 Andy: Hey Mei, I was thinking about that cat mural project we discussed yesterday. Have you had a chance to finalize those latte art ideas?

Mei: Hi Andy! Yes, indeed. I've been working on them and I think they're starting to take shape. Shall we meet at Caroline's Cafe this evening for a chat over chamomile tea?

Andy: Sounds perfect. And I have an idea – what if we grab tacos beforehand and invite Diego for his input too?

Mei: That's a splendid idea! And let's discuss the stray cats' food situation while we're at it. I believe Noor's robotics club could help with that.

Andy: Absolutely! See you there later tonight. Oh, and I've been thinking about some rhythm algorithms and a violin performance for the mural event.

Mei: That sounds exciting! Let's meet earlier at the park tomorrow with chamomile tea for the stray cats before our meeting at Caroline's Cafe.
