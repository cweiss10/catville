 Peter: Hey Leo, heard you're joining our cat mural project? I've got some ideas for those mechanical birds.

Leo: Ah, Peter! Great timing. I was just discussing that with Caroline and Samantha this morning. We thought your input would be invaluable. By the way, Noor's robotics students are on board too.

Peter: That sounds fantastic! And Andy suggested we should involve Mei as well. Let's grab some street tacos to fuel our creativity later?

Leo: Absolutely! I'll bring a kitten for inspiration, and we can catch up with Diego under the old oak tree. See you there!
 Andy: "Hey Samantha, I was thinking about our art project and I thought you might be interested in this – I want to add city sounds to the mechanical birds, and I was hoping you could incorporate your bird melodies too."

Samantha: "I'd love to help with that, Andy. Let's meet under the old oak tree tomorrow at 10:00 AM to discuss further details. Oh, and I also arranged a jam session for my students and friends; maybe we could incorporate that as well?"
