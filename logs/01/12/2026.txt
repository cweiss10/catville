Caroline is at the hospital.
Peter is at the town_hall.
Mei is at the gym.
Noor is at the theater.
Leo is at the theater.
 Noor: "Hey Leo! Fancy meeting you here at the theater late, aren't you usually playing tunes elsewhere?"

Leo: "Surprise! I thought we could use this quiet hour for some practice with Diego on our cat mural project. How about grabbing a bite beforehand?"

Noor: "Great idea! Let's grab some of Caroline's special latte art inspired by chamomile. She told me you'd like it."

Leo: "Ah, the one with the seeds? I can't wait to see what she's brewed up! And speaking of seeds, have you tried Samantha's logic puzzle yet?"

Noor: "Not yet, but I've heard rumors about it being quite a challenge. Let's save that for another night, though. For now, let's focus on our mural."

Leo: "Agreed! Now, where did we put those headphones last time? We need them for practicing under the oak tree tomorrow."
