 Samantha: Hey Leo, I saw your sketches for the mechanical bird at the museum. They're quite impressive!

Leo: Thanks, Samantha! I was hoping you could help me incorporate them into our cat mural project. Did we set a time to discuss it?

Samantha: Yes, we're meeting with Caroline at her cafe tomorrow afternoon. Let's also bring noise-cancelling headphones for the rhythm discussion Andy mentioned.

Leo: Sounds good! Speaking of music, I promised Peter I'd bring tacos to our meeting at Diego's robotics club after school today. Want to join?

Samantha: That would be nice, but I should probably finish discussing the project details with Andy first. See you there later, Leo.
 Andy: Hey Peter, I was thinking about our cat mural project today. I thought we could finalize some latte art concepts tonight under that old oak tree?

Peter: That sounds great, Andy! I've been wanting to work on those details with you and Diego. Let's invite him over too. And don't forget the cat food and snacks!

Andy: Perfect! I'll send a message to Diego right now. See you there at 7 PM then?

Peter: Absolutely, Andy. Can't wait for our collaborative session!

(The following day)

Peter: Hey Noor, remember our meeting about the cat mural project tomorrow? We should rehearse with Leo beforehand at the park around 10 AM.

Noor: Yes, Peter! I'll make sure my kids are there too. Leo and I will be ready to go. Let's meet under the old oak tree as you mentioned.

Peter: Sounds perfect! I'm looking forward to it. See you then!
