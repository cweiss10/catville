Leo: That sounds amazing, Noor! Remember our old busking duets under the oak tree? Let's work on those bird melodies soon.

Noor: Absolutely! And I have some seeds for the community garden if you want them for your tacos.

Leo: You're a lifesaver, Noor! Thanks for that. See you later at the gym, where we can discuss stretch routines and headphones for our practice sessions?

Noor: Sounds perfect, Leo. Looking forward to it!
 Peter: Hey Mei, I hope you got my text about shifting the brainstorming session to Caroline's Café tomorrow?

Mei: Yes, Peter! That works perfectly for me. Let's make it a taco night too, just like your idea for the cat mural project.

Peter: Brilliant! Caroline's excited about it as well, and Diego said he'd bring coffee and tacos. Looking forward to seeing you there.

Mei: I can't wait! And I brought chamomile seeds for our mural project, just like the ones we both love from the community garden. See you tomorrow!

Peter: Perfect timing, as always, Mei. Can't wait for our collaborative brainstorming session over tacos and good company.
 Samantha: "Hey Caroline, nice to see you early today. I heard about your special plans for Stray-13."

Caroline: "Oh Samantha! I'm so glad you asked. Diego and I are working on a unique taco recipe for them, inspired by his latest mural. Have you tried those carrot cakes yet behind the cafe? They're a hit!"

Samantha: "Yes, they're lovely. Maybe we could discuss our cat mural project there tomorrow after the café closes down? With those noise-cancelling headphones, of course."

Caroline: "Sounds like a plan! I'll bring coffee and a slice of carrot cake for us to enjoy while we brainstorm. Let's make this mural something special."
