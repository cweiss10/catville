Andy is at the town_hall.
Samantha is at the hospital.
Peter is at the park.
Mei is at the hospital.
Diego is at the park.
Leo is at the train_station.
 Peter: Hey Diego, I heard you got a new kitten! Mind if I swing by later to meet him?

Diego: Of course, Peter! Just remember to be gentle. You know I'm still working on my knee. We can grab some street tacos while you're here too.

Peter: Perfect. I'll bring that chamomile tea you mentioned for our meeting tomorrow under the oak tree. Let's make this cat mural something special for our town, like we talked with Mei and Samantha.

Diego: Agreed. And remember, stretch well before playing with the kitten so you don't aggravate your old injuries. See you later!

Peter: Will do, Diego. Thanks for being understanding about all this. I really appreciate it.
 Samantha: Hey Caroline, I was thinking about our chat at the market. Leo's ideas for the mural are really taking shape, aren't they?

Caroline: Absolutely, Samantha! And speaking of which, I heard from Diego that he'll be joining us under the old oak tree tomorrow. Exciting times!

Samantha: Yes, it is. I can't wait to discuss latte bird possibilities with you and Noor over chamomile lattes.

Caroline: Me too! And don't forget, I heard Andy discussing robotics elements for the design. Maybe we can collaborate on that as well?

Samantha: That sounds fantastic, Caroline. Let's make this project a community success story. See you tomorrow at the oak tree!
