 Andy: Hey Caroline, thanks again for letting us rehearse at your café tomorrow. I can bring snacks if you'd like?

Caroline: Oh, no need Andy! But street tacos do sound delightful. Let's make it a gathering to remember. And don't forget, I've been wanting that cat-themed latte art Mei promised.

Andy: Absolutely! I'll also be sure to discuss your suggestions with the team. Your place really is the heart of our community, Caroline. It's not just a café, it's a connection hub.

Caroline: (smiling) Well, that makes me happy to hear. Keep the ideas flowing and remember, I'm here for you and the kids. Now, I should get back to preparing for tonight's meeting under the old oak tree. See you soon!
