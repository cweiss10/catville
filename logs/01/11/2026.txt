Andy: Absolutely! I'll also be sure to discuss your suggestions with the team. Your place really is the heart of our community, Caroline. It's not just a café, it's a connection hub.

Caroline: (smiling) Well, that makes me happy to hear. Keep the ideas flowing and remember, I'm here for you and the kids. Now, I should get back to preparing for tonight's meeting under the old oak tree. See you soon!

Andy: That sounds fantastic! And speaking of the mural, Caroline suggested creating cat-themed latte art during our meeting at her café tomorrow. Mei agreed to bring seeds for the community garden.

Diego: Ah, yes! I heard about that from Leo. He's excited to share some sketches he found near the market for mechanical birds we could incorporate into the design. We should finalize all plans under the old oak tree tomorrow afternoon.

Andy: Absolutely! I also wanted to thank you again for your help with our collaborative projects at the restaurant. You're a valuable asset to this town, Diego.

Diego: Thanks for the kind words, Andy. Let's make sure we keep the community involvement strong and put on an amazing show. See you tomorrow!

Andy: That's great! Mei and I also finalized our plans, bringing snacks and headphones for focus. We agreed to meet at Caroline's Café at 7 AM instead of the park. How do you feel about that?

Diego: Sounds perfect. Let's get our creative juices flowing over some coffee before we hit the old oak tree with our designs. And I heard Leo's excited about the tacos and stretch routine tonight, if you're up for it?

Andy: Absolutely! It'll be a great opportunity to bond as a team before we transform that mural. Looking forward to it, Diego. Thanks for your enthusiasm!
