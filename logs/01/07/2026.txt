 Diego: "Hey Leo, heard you're bringing the mechanical birds for our mural rehearsal? That should be quite a spectacle."

Leo: "Yep, thought it could add an interesting twist! Remember our old busking duets under the oak tree? I'm excited to recreate that energy."

Diego: "Absolutely! Don't forget my street tacos and twigs from the oak. We can grab a quick bite before we start, just like old times."

Leo: "Can't wait, Diego. And speaking of old times, you should check out these improvisation tricks Samantha showed me for the bird melodies. It'll be something special!"
