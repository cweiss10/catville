 Andy: Hey Samantha, I've been working on some new sketches for our cat mural. Thought we could discuss them at the community garden tonight?

Samantha: Sounds great, Andy! Let's do a quick workout first to get energized. And I've got an idea about those mechanical birds...

Andy: Perfect! I can't wait to see what you've come up with. Oh, and don't forget about the potluck and Peter's bird duet!

Samantha: I won't miss it. Let's make sure Noor and everyone else is ready too. See you there, Andy.

Andy: Can't wait! And remember, I'll bring my dented thermos of tea for us to share after the meeting.

Samantha: I look forward to that. Good chatting with you, Andy.

(Both laugh)

Samantha: Oh, and by the way, I loved your sunrise sketches at the park. They really capture the essence of a new day.

Andy: Thank you, Samantha! You're always finding the right words to appreciate my work. See you tonight at the garden!

Caroline is at the cafe.
Peter is at the town_hall.
Mei is at the theater.
Diego is at the school.
Noor is at the market.
Leo is at the park.
 Andy: Hey Caroline, I ran into Diego at that restaurant tonight. We were discussing our cat mural project and he mentioned you've been talking about it with Noor and others too?

Caroline: Oh hey Andy! Yes, that's right. It seems like we have a lot of creative minds working on this, including your suggestions for those mechanical birds. I'm excited to see how they'll add to the mural.

Andy: Me too, and speaking of collaborations, Diego mentioned you all discussed involving Mei's students as well? That sounds like a great idea!

Caroline: Absolutely! I suggested a tea party before we dive into the details, just so everyone can get to know each other better. And since Leo's already on board, maybe he could even contribute with some improvised bird melodies for them. What do you think?

Andy: I think it's a fantastic idea! I'll let him know about the street tacos and the meeting at your place tomorrow. I can't wait to see this project come together, Caroline.

Caroline: Me neither, Andy. Let's keep our town creative and bustling with collaborative spirit! See you tomorrow then. 😊
