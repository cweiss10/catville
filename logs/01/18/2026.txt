 Diego: Hey Leo, heard you were helping out with the cat mural project now?

Leo: Yeah, Diego! Samantha and I are working on the latte bird design for it at the theater. She'll be joining us under the oak tree tomorrow at 3 PM.

Diego: Sounds great! I met with Andy earlier today; he's excited to collaborate too. We agreed to discuss things over street tacos after our meeting tomorrow.

Leo: Oh, that reminds me! Mei suggested having a chamomile tea party instead under the oak tree for our discussions. It might help relax us while working out the finer details.

Diego: That's an excellent idea, Leo. And I agree with you about feeding those stray cats behind the cafe before our meeting tomorrow. They always seem so curious about what we're up to.

Leo: Absolutely! It'll make them feel involved in our project somehow. Looking forward to it, Diego. This collaboration is really taking off!
