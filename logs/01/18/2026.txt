 Diego: Hey Leo, heard you were helping out with the cat mural project now?

Leo: Yeah, Diego! Samantha and I are working on the latte bird design for it at the theater. She'll be joining us under the oak tree tomorrow at 3 PM.

Diego: Sounds great! I met with Andy earlier today; he's excited to collaborate too. We agreed to discuss things over street tacos after our meeting tomorrow.

Leo: Oh, that reminds me! Mei suggested having a chamomile tea party instead under the oak tree for our discussions. It might help relax us while working out the finer details.

Diego: That's an excellent idea, Leo. And I agree with you about feeding those stray cats behind the cafe before our meeting tomorrow. They always seem so curious about what we're up to.

Leo: Absolutely! It'll make them feel involved in our project somehow. Looking forward to it, Diego. This collaboration is really taking off!

Noor: Oh, that's great to hear! I found some patterns online that might fit well with Leo's design. I was planning on bringing them up at tomorrow's meeting under the oak tree, along with chamomile tea. How about we also discuss Peter's ideas from his meeting with Diego last night?

Peter: Sounds perfect! I can't wait to collaborate with your robotics club for interactive elements in the project. And I think involving my music could add a unique touch, don't you agree?

Noor: Absolutely! Let's make sure we have everyone's input during our meeting tomorrow afternoon. Oh, and Samantha has some freshly baked treats for the team too. We should ensure Diego's kitten feels special during this collaboration as well. Looking forward to it!
 Samantha: Hey Caroline, I hope you don't mind me bringing up the mural project again. We have a meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow at 3 PM.

Caroline: Of course not, Sam! I'm super excited about it. And I've been thinking, maybe Diego and Peter would be perfect for the project too? What do you think?

Samantha: That sounds great. Let's make sure to feed the strays before our meeting, as Noor suggested. Looking forward to seeing your latte art skills in action!

Caroline: Absolutely! And maybe we can grab a cup of coffee afterwards? I've got some new ideas for the latte bird design that I'd love to discuss. Let's make this mural project unforgettable for our town!
