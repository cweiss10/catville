 Caroline: "Hey Diego, I've been thinking about that mechanical bird for our mural – how about we make it a latte art feature at the tea party too?"

Diego: "I like that idea! And speaking of collaboration, have you talked to Noor yet about helping Leo with his sketches? We could use some logic puzzles in the design."

Caroline: "Not yet, but I'll reach out to her later today. Let's also ask if she can bring her kitten – they'd be a great addition!"

Diego: "Sounds perfect! And don't forget about our new stretch routine for the performance under the old oak tree."

Caroline: "You got it. I'll make sure to remind everyone at the potluck meeting tomorrow."
