 Mei: "Good evening, Diego! I heard you were here earlier with Noor. Did you discuss our mural plans? The chamomile seeds are ready if we want to incorporate them."

Diego: "Hey Mei! Yes, indeed. We're thinking of adding robotics club elements and Andy's latte art. I brought some snacks for everyone, as Noor suggested. Let's not forget to stretch before our meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow!"

Mei: "Sounds perfect! I can't wait to see how it all comes together. And I appreciate your thoughtfulness with the snacks."

Diego: "It's a team effort, Mei. Remember, we're making this mural truly memorable for our town. Let's share some street tacos after finalizing designs!"
