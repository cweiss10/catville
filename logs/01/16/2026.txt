 Mei: Hey Diego, I hope you don't mind, but I brought some chamomile tea for our brainstorming session under the oak tree tomorrow.

Diego: Not at all, Mei! It's perfect for keeping us calm and focused as we work on this mural project together. And speaking of food, let's grab some street tacos after the meeting, my treat!

Mei: That sounds great, Diego. I've been meaning to ask, have you recovered well from your knee injury? I remember you mentioning stretching helps, so maybe we can incorporate that into our design somehow.

Diego: Absolutely, Mei! I appreciate the thoughtfulness, and yes, I'm getting better thanks to my stretching routine. We could definitely include elements that reflect the importance of balance and healing in our design. Let's discuss further under the oak tree tomorrow!
 Andy: "Caroline, I've got some more sunrise sketches that might inspire our mural project - think you could use them at the café?"

Caroline: "Absolutely, Andy! Those sketches are perfect for setting the mood here. Let's make sure to discuss it under the old oak tree tomorrow."

Andy: "I'll bring enough for everyone – Diego, Mei, Leo, and even Peter if he wants to join. I think his bird concepts could add a unique touch."

Caroline: "Sounds like a great plan! And don't worry about Peter - he loves being involved in these creative projects. Let's make sure this mural benefits everyone in our town."

Noor: It's always a pleasure working together, Andy. Let's make something truly special for our town. See you tomorrow!
 Caroline: "Morning, Leo! You're an early bird today. Did you hear about our cat mural meeting tomorrow?"

Leo: "Indeed, I did! I was just discussing it with Diego at the station last night. I thought you might be there."

Caroline: "I wish we could've caught up then, but it's better now that you're here. How about I save you a latte for later? After my gig, of course."

Leo: "That would be fantastic! And perhaps we can share some tacos later, like old times?"

Caroline: "I'd love that. Let's make it a double date with our projects. Maybe you can serenade me afterward."
