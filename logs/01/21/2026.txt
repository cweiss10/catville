 Peter: Hey Mei, I was thinking about our project today. Your robotics for mechanical birds could really make it pop!

Mei: Hi Peter, I appreciate that! Let's discuss more under the old oak tree after lunch, shall we? How about a chamomile latte to go with it?

Peter: Sounds perfect. Before that, I should probably hit the gym for my knee exercises. Want to work out together sometime?

Mei: That would be great, Peter! Speaking of fitness, remember you promised Samantha some chamomile seeds for her garden?

Peter: Oh right, thanks for reminding me! I'm looking forward to our meeting this weekend. Let's make it memorable!
