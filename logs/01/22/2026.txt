Peter: "Got it, Caroline. Looking forward to our work session under that oak tree."
 Samantha: Hey Diego, I didn't expect to see you here so late!

Diego: Samantha, looks like our paths keep crossing. I was just finishing up my routine. Heard about the latte birds idea for the oak tree meet?

Samantha: Absolutely! And I think it'll be great if we could collaborate with your violin music too. It'd make quite a spectacle.

Diego: Agreed, sounds like a fantastic plan. I'll bring Chamomile tea for us and my kitten for some musical companionship. Looking forward to it!

Samantha: Me too, Diego. Let's hope Andy joins us as well. Let's make this an unforgettable afternoon for our town.
