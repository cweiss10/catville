 Samantha: "Mei, I brought the chamomile tea you mentioned for our collaboration. I hope it's to your liking."

Mei: "Oh, Samantha! This is perfect. And look who decided to join us - my daughter seems fascinated by your coding setup!"

Mei: "That's an intriguing idea! Let's involve everyone, including Andy and perhaps Caroline, in creating something special for our town."
