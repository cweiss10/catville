Peter: Absolutely! I can meet up with you and Diego at Caroline's for some chamomile lattes before we test run those birds. Samantha should be there too.

Andy: Agreed! I can't wait to see your mechanical birds in action there. By the way, I spoke with Mei earlier today about chamomile lattes this afternoon. She seems keen on contributing to the event as well.

Diego: Great! Looking forward to it. Let's make sure we discuss more details later today at the community garden then. Oh, and don't forget to invite Samantha too, I heard she's been working on some interesting ideas for our project.

Samantha: That sounds perfect! Also, I thought it would be nice if we could discuss your flowers in relation to the project during our meeting. What do you think?

Noor: Wonderful idea, Samantha! Incorporating my flowers into the mechanical birds will create a beautiful display for the community event. We'll have something truly special to share with everyone.
