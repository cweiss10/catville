 Samantha: "Mei, I heard you're involving your students in our mural garden discussions. That sounds wonderful! Would they be interested in helping with the mechanical bird project too?"

Mei: "Absolutely! They love getting hands-on with projects like these. Peter and Noor are invited as well, right? We can brainstorm some ideas over fresh mint tea at our meeting under the oak tree tomorrow."

Samantha: "Indeed. I've arranged for a tea station and snacks. Looking forward to collaborating with everyone!"

Peter: Yes, Caroline! We're making it a joint effort now, involving Mei's students and a kitten mascot too. The team is meeting under the oak tree tonight at 7:30 PM to finalize everything, just as you suggested.

Caroline: That sounds amazing! And I can't wait for our bird-themed latte art during taco night. By the way, have you talked to Leo about incorporating Noor's melodies?

Peter: Not yet, but I plan on discussing it with him tonight after testing out Diego's bird sketches under the oak tree. Thanks for reminding me about that, Caroline – your ideas always make things better!
 Diego: Hey Leo, I ran into Peter at the cafe today, and we've been brainstorming some cool ideas for the performance. We'd love to have you on board with your mechanical birds.

Leo: Hey Diego! That sounds amazing! Caroline and I are excited about it too. We were thinking about a bird-themed latte art for the taco night. What do you think?

Diego: I think that's brilliant, Leo. It'll definitely make our get-together more unique. And don't forget, we should invite Samantha as well. She's got some great ideas for the project.

Leo: You're right! I'll make sure to reach out to her and Caroline about it. Let's keep this magic rolling, Diego!
