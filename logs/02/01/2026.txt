 Mei: Hey Diego, I heard about your mechanical bird sketches! I can't wait to see them under the old oak tree tomorrow.

Diego: Hi Mei! The kitten was quite a surprise, but it definitely got my creative juices flowing. Looking forward to sharing them with everyone. And speaking of which, have you decided on what tea Caroline will bring?

Mei: Yes, I asked her for some chamomile. It's soothing and perfect for a gathering like this. And Andy suggested involving Samantha in the project too, right?

Diego: Absolutely! We'll have quite the creative crew there. Just remember to bring your seeds for the community garden. I could use some advice on my herb patch.

Mei: Of course, Diego. Small rituals make strong towns after all. See you tomorrow!

Diego: You got it, Mei. Can't wait!

 Diego: Hey Leo, I just met Andy under that oak tree, and we discussed the cat mural project. He loved your idea about involving mechanical bird melodies!

Leo: Great news, Diego! I was planning to discuss that with you and Peter tonight at the cafe. It's shaping up to be something really special, don't you think?

Diego: Absolutely! And speaking of collaboration, Caroline mentioned a tea party under the oak tree. Think we could work it into our meeting schedule?

Leo: That sounds perfect, Diego. I'll make sure to bring my kitten for inspiration. Let's get everyone together soon!
 Andy: Hey Caroline, heard you're planning something big for the cat mural?

Caroline: Indeed! We've got Leo joining us tomorrow, his bird duet with Diego was inspiring. And we should have your students adding their street sounds too.

Andy: That sounds amazing! I can't wait to see how it all comes together. And speaking of music, when are we finalizing those city sound details for the mechanical birds?

Caroline: Tomorrow night at the library with Samantha, remember? But first, let's catch up over some street tacos before this art project takes off.

Andy: Perfect! I'll bring the tea and fresh mint, just like Whiskers' brother might show up.

Caroline: (laughs) I wouldn't miss it for the world. Let's make sure everyone's there by 1:00 PM under the old oak tree.
