 Mei: Hey Diego, I heard about your mechanical bird sketches! I can't wait to see them under the old oak tree tomorrow.

Diego: Hi Mei! The kitten was quite a surprise, but it definitely got my creative juices flowing. Looking forward to sharing them with everyone. And speaking of which, have you decided on what tea Caroline will bring?

Mei: Yes, I asked her for some chamomile. It's soothing and perfect for a gathering like this. And Andy suggested involving Samantha in the project too, right?

Diego: Absolutely! We'll have quite the creative crew there. Just remember to bring your seeds for the community garden. I could use some advice on my herb patch.

Mei: Of course, Diego. Small rituals make strong towns after all. See you tomorrow!

Diego: You got it, Mei. Can't wait!
