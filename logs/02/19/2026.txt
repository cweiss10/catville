 Andy: "Hey Mei, I didn't expect to see you here so late. We have quite a bit in common for our first meeting at 3 AM!"

Mei: "Surprisingly, this time of night suits me best when inspiration strikes. Your passion for art really resonates with my love for preserving stories. Let's collaborate on that cat mural project, Andy."

Andy: "I'd be honored to work together, Mei. Let's gather our friends tomorrow under the old oak tree and create something truly special."

Mei: "Agreed! I've brought seeds for the mural garden too. Perhaps we can make it a soothing atmosphere with chamomile lattes and noise-cancelling headphones, just like you suggested earlier today?"

Andy: "That sounds perfect! I'll bring my thermos of tea as well. Looking forward to our creative journey together."
