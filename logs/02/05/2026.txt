 Andy: Hey Mei, I just had an idea for our mechanical bird project that I think you'd love!

Mei: Oh, Andy! You're always full of creativity. What is it this time?

Andy: I was thinking we could involve your zine club in the tea party under the old oak tree. They could make some unique bird-themed zines to decorate the area.

Mei: That sounds lovely! I'll run it by the crew and let you know what they think. Maybe we can even add a cat mural, since you mentioned the old oak tree will have cat murals too?

Andy: Absolutely! And don't forget about the street tacos and quiet spaces. We want this to be an event that brings everyone together, just like our town.

Mei: You always know how to make a community event special, Andy. I'm excited to see it all come together. Let's keep in touch as we work on the details!
 Peter: Hey Diego, looking forward to our meeting tonight at the theater. I've been working on my mechanical bird for the cat mural.

Diego: Great timing, Peter! Let's discuss it further and make sure we take care of your knee during the project. And don't forget about that workout before our meet-up!

Peter: You're right, Diego. I appreciate your reminders and help with this. Speaking of which, have you heard from Noor about organizing that tea party under the old oak tree?

Diego: Yes, she's on board. We agreed to share street tacos afterwards as well. And I've been talking to Andy about inviting Samantha and her class for collaboration too!

Peter: That sounds amazing. What do you think about a joint event with Leo's zine club? It could really bring our town together.

Diego: Great idea, Peter! I'll invite Andy to discuss it further. Oh, and I was thinking of bringing my kitten for some tacos after the event. How about you?

Peter: That sounds like fun, Diego. Maybe we can even ask Andy if he can bring his dog too!
