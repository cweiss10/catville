Peter: Absolutely, Sam! That's a fantastic idea. I was thinking about discussing it with Leo too. How about we collaborate on that?

Samantha: I'd love to work together on it. Let's make this project something special for everyone.

 Samantha: Hey Noor, I was thinking about our meeting tomorrow. Let's grab some tacos beforehand at that little stall by the park, just like old times?

Noor: Absolutely, Samantha! That sounds delightful. And don't forget to bring your noise-cancelling headphones for our collaboration session under the oak tree. I can't wait to see the fusion of mechanical birds and cats come alive!
 Caroline: "Hey Leo, you're just in time! I was thinking about your bird sketches for our project."

Leo: "Ah, Caroline! I've got some new ones I'd love to share. Did I hear right that we're meeting at the oak tree later?"

Caroline: "That's correct! And don't forget about the tacos beforehand – it'll be a great way to start things off."

Leo: "Tacos? My favorite! I can't wait. Let's catch up more then, and maybe you can even join me for a street duet?"

Caroline: "I'd love that, but only if my latte-art doesn't need my attention first."

Leo: "Deal! See you under the oak tree tonight, Caroline."

Noor: "I'm really looking forward to it. Let's make sure Andy brings his sketchbook and we brew that special coffee you mentioned!"
