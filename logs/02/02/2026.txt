 Diego: Hey Noor, I've been thinking about our cat mural project, and I think Leo's mechanical birds could really add something special.

Noor: Absolutely! I've been working on improving them with the robotics club. By the way, have you decided on a time for our pre-meeting tea party?

Diego: Yes, how about 7:00 PM under the old oak tree? And I was thinking we could incorporate street tacos and even introduce my kitten as part of the cat mural. What do you think?

Noor: That sounds amazing! We can involve Mei's and Samantha's class, just like Andy suggested. Plus, it would be great to get some input from your students too, like Peter from the zine club. Let's make this a community event!

Diego: Agreed. I can't wait for our meeting under the old oak tree tomorrow evening. See you there!

Noor: Can't wait! And don't forget to bring your kitten! Let's catch up more at the tea party. Bye for now, Diego. Take care of that knee!
 Samantha: "Hey Peter, I overheard you talking about the cat mural. How's the bird melody coming along?"

Peter: "Hey Samantha! Great to see you at the station again. Well, we've made some progress with Leo's help, but could use your expertise on making them sound more authentic."

Samantha: "I'd be happy to help. Let's work together this weekend under the old oak tree, as planned."

Peter: "Sounds perfect. And by the way, I heard about Mei's seed-gathering ritual. That's a great touch for our collaborations."

Leo is at the market.
 Samantha: Hey Caroline, I've got an idea for the bird project – Leo's melodies could make them feel more alive.

Caroline: That's brilliant, Sam! Let's discuss it further at our usual spot under the old oak tree. Bring Biscuit too if you like.

Samantha: I will, and maybe we can invite Peter to join us? His latte art could really enhance the design.

Caroline: Absolutely! And don't forget about our seed-gathering ritual tomorrow before we start the mural. Can't wait for those chamomile lattes and street tacos!

Samantha: Agreed, see you there at 1 PM sharp!

Caroline: You got it, looking forward to it. By the way, Peter's interested in trying your famous tacos too.

Samantha: Then make sure to save some for him! See you soon under the old oak tree.
