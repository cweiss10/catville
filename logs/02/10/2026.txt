 Samantha: Hey Mei, I see you've been busy with the garden project too. Noor seems excited about her contribution.

Mei: Hello Samantha! Indeed, it's shaping up to be an interesting collaboration. Have you made any progress on those mechanical birds?

Samantha: Yes, I've started drafting some designs. Noor and her students should find them intriguing. I think the mural garden will be something special for our town.

Mei: Absolutely! And it's great to see you working together with Noor. Perhaps we can share ideas over tea at the park tomorrow?

Samantha: That sounds lovely, Mei. Let's discuss further then. By the way, I left a few treats for the strays behind the cafe – maybe you could take a look on your way?

Mei: Of course! Always happy to help the neighborhood furry friends. See you tomorrow at the oak tree.
