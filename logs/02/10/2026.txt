Samantha: Yes, I've started drafting some designs. Noor and her students should find them intriguing. I think the mural garden will be something special for our town.

Mei: Absolutely! And it's great to see you working together with Noor. Perhaps we can share ideas over tea at the park tomorrow?

Samantha: That sounds lovely, Mei. Let's discuss further then. By the way, I left a few treats for the strays behind the cafe – maybe you could take a look on your way?

Mei: Of course! Always happy to help the neighborhood furry friends. See you tomorrow at the oak tree.

Peter: Absolutely, Diego! It's a perfect opportunity to blend our talents. And speaking of blending, let's grab those tacos you mentioned after finalizing everything with Caroline and me.

Diego: Agreed! Let's make this collaboration under the old oak tree something special. And remember, stretching is crucial before taco time.

Peter: (laughs) Got it. I'll try to be as flexible as your knee allows, Diego. See you at the tea party!

Diego: Looking forward to it, Peter. And let's make sure we invite some of my gym-goers to your community garden project too.
