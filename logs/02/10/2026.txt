Samantha: Yes, I've started drafting some designs. Noor and her students should find them intriguing. I think the mural garden will be something special for our town.

Mei: Absolutely! And it's great to see you working together with Noor. Perhaps we can share ideas over tea at the park tomorrow?

Samantha: That sounds lovely, Mei. Let's discuss further then. By the way, I left a few treats for the strays behind the cafe – maybe you could take a look on your way?

Mei: Of course! Always happy to help the neighborhood furry friends. See you tomorrow at the oak tree.

Andy: "Sounds great! I was thinking we could bring tea for everyone at the cat mural event too. How about we finalize everything under that very oak tonight?"

Leo: "I like it. See you there, Andy. By the way, I heard your mural project might include some of Mei's students and even a kitten as the event mascot."

Andy: Looking forward to it. And by the way, I heard about your bird-themed event with everyone under the old oak tree. That sounds like a wonderful idea, can't wait to see the decorations from your robotics club!

Mei: Thank you, Andy! It's all coming together nicely. I think it'll be a great night for both projects. Let's make sure to bring enough tea and tacos, too!
