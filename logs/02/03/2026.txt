 Diego: Hey Noor, good to see you at the park again. Did Peter give you a heads up about that tea party under the oak tree?

Noor: Absolutely, Diego! I'm looking forward to it. And thanks for reminding me about the street tacos – the students will love them! By the way, did Leo show you his latest sketches? They're fantastic!

Diego: Yes, and Mei is excited to see them too. I hope your mechanical birds can join our meeting as well. My old knee is feeling a bit better lately, so maybe we can even meet earlier tomorrow?

Noor: That sounds great, Diego! Early afternoon tea parties are my favorite. Let's make sure our zine club friends come too – this project could really bring our town together. Looking forward to it!
 Samantha: "Peter, thanks for joining us today – your mint tea was quite a delightful surprise."

Peter: "My pleasure, Samantha. I heard about the mechanical bird project and couldn't resist getting involved. Plus, street tacos sound delicious!"

Samantha: "Indeed! And don't worry if you get lost in conversation – logic puzzles are always around to keep me company."

Peter: "Ha! I think we'll do just fine working together. Let's make this cat mural something special for the neighborhood."

 Peter: Hey Mei, I was thinking about our chat at the library the other night. I'd love for you and your zine club friends to join us under the old oak tree this weekend.

Mei: Peter, that sounds like a wonderful idea! I'll make sure my team is there, and maybe we can even set up a mini-zine corner if everyone is okay with it?

Peter: Absolutely, I think it would be great to have your creative touch at our event. And Caroline mentioned Diego will bring street tacos - I'm really looking forward to this!
 Andy: Hey Noor! I heard you've expanded our meeting under the old oak tree today. Great idea, by the way!

Noor: Hi Andy! Yes, I thought it'd be nice to bring more minds together. Mei and her friends are joining in too, and they're keen on collaborating with your cat mural project.

Andy: That sounds amazing! I can't wait to see what we come up with. By the way, Diego mentioned he has Leo's sketch for the cat mural.

Noor: Oh, perfect! We should also ask him about bringing his street tacos for lunch. And don't forget our chamomile latte tradition. It'll be a wonderful day!

Andy: Absolutely! I've been looking forward to it since our conversation at the train station earlier this week. Let's make sure we bring seeds for the community garden too.

Noor: You got it, Andy. See you soon under the old oak tree!
