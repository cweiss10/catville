 Andy: Hey Leo, didn't expect you here so late! I heard you were busking earlier at the market.

Leo: Ah, Andy! I saw Mei there too. You know she has a knack for finding me! Speaking of which, I couldn't resist her idea about the latte art collaboration. Have you decided on your contribution yet?

Andy: Absolutely! My sketches could make for some intriguing designs. We can discuss it further over those street tacos she mentioned tonight. By the way, have you spoken with Samantha about our plans for the mechanical birds in the mural?

Leo: Not yet, but I'll reach out soon. I think my improvisations might add a unique touch to their movements. Maybe we can work on that impromptu duet Caroline suggested beforehand as well.

Andy: That sounds like a great idea! Let's meet under the old oak tree tonight after our individual meetings, say around 7:00 PM? We can share ideas over fresh mint tea and coffee. I'll bring my thermos too.

Leo: Sounds perfect. See you then, Andy!
