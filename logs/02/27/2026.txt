 Samantha: Hey Diego, saw you were here earlier. Mind if I join for a bit? I found some interesting new libraries that could be useful for our mechanical bird project.

Diego: Of course, Sam! That's perfect timing. I was just thinking about reaching out to discuss the design. Let's grab those street tacos and mint tea under the old oak tree tomorrow like we planned?

Samantha: Absolutely. I've also got some equipment you might find useful for the project, if needed. And Leo seemed pretty excited about our collaboration too.

Diego: Great! I can't wait to see what we come up with. Thanks for your help, and let's work together on making this project something special. See you under the oak tree tomorrow!

(Under the old oak tree)

Andy: So here we are, surrounded by our creative friends, ready to bring our ideas to life. Leo, I can hardly wait to see what you've been working on with those city sounds.

Leo: Well, Andy, I think it's going to be a fantastic addition to your murals! Let's give these mechanical birds a duet that truly encapsulates our town's spirit.
 Samantha: Hey Noor, I saw your setup for the robotics club today – impressive! I was thinking about collaborating on a project for our town, using mechanical birds and violin serenades.

Noor: That sounds amazing, Samantha! Let's make it happen under the old oak tree tonight, as you mentioned earlier? We can gather some street tacos, mint tea, and maybe even try Diego's chamomile lattes for a creative boost!
