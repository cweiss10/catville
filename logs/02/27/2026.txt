 Samantha: Hey Diego, saw you were here earlier. Mind if I join for a bit? I found some interesting new libraries that could be useful for our mechanical bird project.

Diego: Of course, Sam! That's perfect timing. I was just thinking about reaching out to discuss the design. Let's grab those street tacos and mint tea under the old oak tree tomorrow like we planned?

Samantha: Absolutely. I've also got some equipment you might find useful for the project, if needed. And Leo seemed pretty excited about our collaboration too.

Diego: Great! I can't wait to see what we come up with. Thanks for your help, and let's work together on making this project something special. See you under the oak tree tomorrow!
