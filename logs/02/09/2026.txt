 Samantha: Hey Mei, I was thinking about our mural garden plans and I believe incorporating some of Noor's melodies would be quite fitting.

Mei: Absolutely, Samantha! And speaking of Noor, have you asked her about joining your tea party tomorrow? We could use her creative touch in our project.

Samantha: That's a great idea. I'll talk to Peter during lunch and let you know. I was also thinking we could have tacos with Andy before the gathering, what do you think?

Mei: Tacos sound delightful! I've got my zine club joining the event too. Let's meet up for a quick pre-event get-together this week. How about it?

Samantha: That sounds wonderful. Looking forward to our collaborative efforts coming together for the community.
 Andy: Hey Caroline, I was just thinking about our community event under the old oak tree. Your idea of incorporating Leo's bird sketches into both projects is brilliant!

Caroline: Thanks, Andy! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I've also been discussing it with Diego from the hospital, and he's on board too. We should make sure to involve everyone in our taco night discussions as well.

Andy: That sounds perfect! And don't forget to show off your latte-art skills during our brainstorming sessions – I know Noor's students will love it!

Caroline: You're right, they always enjoy a little artistic inspiration. Let's make this event memorable for everyone involved. See you at the cafe tonight?

Andy: Absolutely! Looking forward to catching up and planning this exciting collaboration together.
