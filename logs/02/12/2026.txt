 Samantha: Hey Mei, I didn't expect to see you here at lunch. We're both usually engrossed in our own worlds.

Mei: Hello Samantha! I was drawn out by the fresh air and the chatter of the zine club meeting. I noticed your notes on the library bulletin board, by the way.

Samantha: Ah, you've found my anonymous contributions. It's a small way to give back, but it brings me joy. Speaking of which, Peter suggested involving Diego in our mural garden project. What do you think?

Mei: That sounds wonderful! Diego's gym-goers could help with the physical labor while we focus on the artistic side. Let's bring it up at our meeting under the oak tree tomorrow. I can't wait to see how this community event unfolds.
 Peter: Hey Noor, I was thinking about our bird project, and I wanted to discuss a potential collaboration with Leo on his murals for the cat mural. What do you think?

Noor: That sounds great, Peter! I was actually planning to invite Mei's zine club to join us under the oak tree this afternoon at the gym. How about we discuss it with everyone there?

Peter: Absolutely! Let's make sure to involve Samantha and Andy as well. And maybe grab some tacos before finalizing everything, just like old times.

Noor: You got it! Looking forward to making a difference in our community together.

 Andy: Hey Leo! Fancy meeting you here at the hospital. I was just heading over for my dentist appointment.

Leo: Ah, Andy! You too? Well, it looks like we're both running on the same schedule today. Say, have you heard about our collaborative project with Peter and the community center?

Andy: Yes! The cat mural, mechanical birds, and zine? I'm so excited about it. We even invited your students to participate, remember?

Leo: Indeed we did. And speaking of that, I heard you all are having a meeting under the old oak tree tonight at 7 PM. Peter mentioned you might be serving street tacos afterward. I'd love to join if you have room for one more.

Andy: Of course! We're always happy to have more hands on deck, and your sketches could definitely contribute to the mechanical birds project. Let's catch up on everything then. See you tonight!
