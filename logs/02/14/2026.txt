 Andy: Hey Diego, I ran into Mei at the museum today. She mentioned you for the mural garden project! Excited for our meeting under the oak tree tomorrow?

Diego: Absolutely, Andy. I've been looking forward to it. And speaking of encounters, did we have a chat at that restaurant around 2 PM yesterday?

Andy: Ah yes, my apologies for not mentioning it earlier! We should probably make sure we bring tea for everyone tomorrow.

Diego: You got it. I'll bring chamomile tea as per our plan. Let's stretch after the meeting and end the day with some street tacos, like old times.

Peter: Sounds like a plan. I'm also thinking Noor's purple theme could work for us. And by the way, I've been meaning to ask—how's your knee injury coming along?

Diego: It's getting there, Peter. With a bit of rest and some extra stretching, I should be good to go in no time. Thanks for asking. See you tomorrow!
 Andy: Hey Caroline, love your new purple hair! How was work today?

Caroline: Thanks, Andy! It's been a whirlwind of lattes and chatter, but I wouldn't have it any other way. How about you? You seem excited about something.

Andy: Ah, yes! We're working on some collaborative projects. You know Mei from the gym? We're planning a city sounds event at her place later this week. Thought we could involve your singing gig too.

Caroline: That sounds amazing, Andy! I'd be thrilled to help out and bring some music to the mix. Let's coordinate and make it happen!

Andy: Absolutely! And don't forget our usual after-gym catch-up? Street tacos are on me this time.

Caroline: You're too kind, Andy. See you at 3 then!
