 Samantha: "Mei, I've been thinking about our chat with Leo earlier today. The mural garden project sounds amazing, especially with your involvement. Have you thought about my headphones for better focus during our discussions?"

Mei: "Absolutely! And the cat mural zine project with Andy seems intriguing too. I'd love to have you and Leo collaborate on some bird-themed latte art as well. Let's save some mint tea for our taco night under the oak tree, shall we?"
 Andy: Hey Diego, I ran into Mei at the museum today. She mentioned you for the mural garden project! Excited for our meeting under the oak tree tomorrow?

Diego: Absolutely, Andy. I've been looking forward to it. And speaking of encounters, did we have a chat at that restaurant around 2 PM yesterday?

Andy: Ah yes, my apologies for not mentioning it earlier! We should probably make sure we bring tea for everyone tomorrow.

Diego: You got it. I'll bring chamomile tea as per our plan. Let's stretch after the meeting and end the day with some street tacos, like old times.

Leo: Fantastic! This project is shaping up to be something really special. I can't wait to see how everything comes together.
