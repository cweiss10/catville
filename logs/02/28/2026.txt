 Diego: Hey Noor, I was just thinking about our plans for the mechanical bird project and the double date under the old oak tree tomorrow. You should join us!

Noor: That sounds wonderful, Diego! I'd love to contribute my robotics club's expertise. And speaking of contributions, have you tried Leo's city sound idea yet?

Diego: Not yet, but it sounds fascinating! Let's invite him to our gathering as well. How about we meet at 5:30 PM like we planned, and then discuss the details over street tacos and mint tea?

Noor: Perfect timing! I'll bring Leo along and some snacks for overwhelmed students too. See you there!
 Samantha: Hey Caroline, I saw you talking with Mei earlier. Did I miss something?

Caroline: Hi Samantha! Yes, we're collaborating on the mural and the mechanical birds project now. Mei's making street tacos and we're meeting at the library tonight. Wanted to share since you might have some ideas too.

Samantha: That sounds amazing, Caroline. I've got some label designs for Mei's seedlings ready if you want to see them? We could discuss sound quality improvements with Peter as well.

Caroline: Absolutely! Let's catch up over chamomile lattes then and make this event even more wonderful. By the way, have you finished feeding the strays yet? I've been meaning to ask.

Samantha: Of course, Caroline. They're all taken care of behind the cafe, as usual. See you tonight!
