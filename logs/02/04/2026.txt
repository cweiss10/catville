Noor is at the library.
Leo is at the school.
 Peter: Hey Mei, I was thinking about our cat mural project and thought we could organize a tea party under that old oak tree. What do you think?

Mei: That sounds delightful, Peter! I've been wanting to collaborate more with the community. Let's involve everyone, including Andy and his sketches, and maybe some street tacos too. And we shouldn't forget Caroline for her bird melodies.

Peter: Absolutely! And how about inviting Leo as well? We can make it a big event. I was also thinking of adding chamomile lattes at the theater, what do you think?

Mei: Chamomile lattes at the theater would be a perfect touch, Peter. It'll add a sense of tranquility to our gathering. Let's make sure we label everything and have plenty of quiet spaces for those who prefer them.

Peter: Great idea! I think this will bring our town together and create something truly special. Here's to finding solace in cups of tea if things get tough.

Mei: Indeed, Peter. Here's to collaboration, creativity, and community spirit.
