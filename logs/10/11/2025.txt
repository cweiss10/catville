Peter: Hey Samantha! Yes, I did. It's shaping up to be quite the collaborative effort. Mei suggested it too, right? I think it'll make for a great addition.

Samantha: Indeed. And we should remember to ask Diego about those street tacos for the neighborhood cats as well. Our town is in for another memorable day.

Peter: You're absolutely right! I've also been talking to Noor and Caroline about contributing their musical and interactive ideas respectively. It's going to be something special, don't you think?

Samantha: It certainly seems that way. Perhaps we can grab a coffee together after the meeting with Andy on Thursday to strategize further?

Peter: Sounds like a plan! Looking forward to it.
 Caroline: Hi Leo! I hope your morning busking went well. Heard you had some musical ideas to share?

Leo: Hey Caroline, indeed! I've got some exciting plans for our mural project. Samantha and I are meeting you and Diego for dinner at Main Street Tacos tonight, how about a double date with Andy? Also, we could rehearse at the park this afternoon if you're free?

Caroline: That sounds wonderful! Can't wait to hear those ideas. And, of course, dinner with friends is always a good idea. Let's make sure our bird duet impresses everyone as much as it does us. See you this evening then!

Leo: Sounds perfect! I'll bring my violin and maybe even get some latte art inspiration from your designs. See you soon, Caroline.
