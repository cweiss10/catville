Diego: Sounds perfect, Andy. See you then! And by the way, I brought some sunrise seeds for the gazebo trees if you'd like them.

Andy: That's thoughtful, Diego! They'll be a great addition to our event. Thanks!
 Peter: Hey Mei, I hope you're doing well! Got any plans for dinner tonight?

Mei: Hi Peter! I'm good, thanks. Actually, Diego and Noor are coming over for tacos to discuss the cat mural project. Care to join us? We could use another set of eyes for brainstorming.

Peter: That sounds great! I'd love to join you all. Let's make sure we nail this bird duet design and strengthen our town's community spirit.

Mei: Absolutely, Peter! The more the merrier. See you tonight under the gazebo trees then.

Peter: Looking forward to it! And thank you for your support with the project, Mei. It means a lot to me.

Mei: Of course, Peter. Let's work together to create something beautiful for our community.

 Andy: Hey Caroline, I grabbed some cat food from Diego for our meeting tonight.

Caroline: Perfect! And Diego brought sunrise seeds for the gazebo trees like you asked. Looking forward to our jam session with him later.

Andy: Me too, can't wait to brainstorm more ideas over coffee at Main Street Tacos tomorrow.

Caroline: Sounds great. Let's also invite Mei and Peter so we can finalize the cat mural and bird duet plans together.

Andy: Agreed! And I'll bring snacks for the stray cats, as promised. Our projects are really starting to come together now.

Caroline: You're right, it feels like things are falling into place. I'm excited about our quadruple date under the gazebo trees on Saturday too. Let's make sure to invite Noor for the rehearsal.

Andy: Absolutely, we should involve her and her friends in the robotics club more. Can't wait to see what they come up with.

Caroline: Me neither! It's going to be a fantastic day ahead. Thanks for being such an amazing collaborator, Andy.

Andy: You too, Caroline. I couldn't ask for a better partner on these projects. Let's keep pushing each other to create something truly special.
