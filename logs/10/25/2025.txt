Peter: Looking forward to it. By the way, have you tried that squirrel latte at the cafÃ© yet? I think you'd love it.

Andy: Sounds interesting! And don't forget about our cat mural project later at my place. Have you seen those interactive elements Samantha's been working on?

Leo: Can't wait to discuss that more! By the way, I borrowed some sunrise seeds from Noor for the gazebo trees as suggested by Caroline. Did you know she grows them herself?

Andy: Really?! That's amazing. You always find the most peculiar yet fascinating things, Leo. Thanks for keeping me in the loop!

Leo: Happy to help, Andy. See you around town then!
 Samantha: (smiling at Noor) Good morning, Noor! I didn't expect to see you here so early.

Noor: Hey Samantha! Morning to you too! Felt like a workout today needed some extra energy. Did you get a good night's sleep?

Samantha: (nodding) Yes, thank you. I was up late working on my mural project with Peter. He seems quite impressed with the robotics progress, which has helped boost my confidence.

Noor: That sounds amazing! Leo mentioned something about it earlier today. How about we grab lunch together after our workouts to discuss more?

Samantha: (grinning) I'd like that. Let's meet under the gazebo trees at 12:30 PM, just as we planned for our mural project meeting with Mei and Andy. And don't forget your violin for our bird duet rehearsal tonight!

Noor: (laughing) Of course, Samantha! Can't wait for our lunch and the rehearsal. Let's also remember to feed the stray cats before dinner as we promised Leo.

Samantha: Agreed. I'll bring some treats from my usual spot behind the cafe. Now let's get started with our workouts!
