 Samantha: "I appreciate your enthusiasm for this project, Diego. Your idea about the bird duets sounds fascinating."

Diego: "Great! Let's collaborate with Leo on it then. I'll reach out to him later tonight. How about we continue brainstorming over some street tacos at your place after our meeting tomorrow?"

Samantha: "That sounds wonderful, Diego. My apartment isn't far from Main Street Tacos, so we can go there for the meeting and head over straightaway afterward."

Diego: "Perfect! I'll invite Leo and Caroline as well, since they might be interested in contributing. Looking forward to seeing everyone tomorrow!"

Samantha: "Me too, Diego. And remember, if it gets too loud or distracting for me, I can always put on my noise-cancelling headphones."

Diego: "Got it, Samantha. Let's make this mural project an amazing one!"
 Caroline: Hey Noor, I hope you're up for a fun surprise! Let's kick off our mural brainstorming session at the smoothie bar this afternoon before heading to Main Street Tacos.

Noor: That sounds like a great idea, Caroline! Let's invite Andy too. We can also discuss Leo's bird duet idea with Peter and Samantha there. See you then!

Caroline: Can't wait, Noor. And don't forget, I'll be singing during the meeting!

Noor: Absolutely, Caroline. Your music will set the perfect mood for our creative endeavor!
