Peter: "Definitely, Samantha. And I think involving Noor's students in design discussions could be a great idea!"

Samantha: "I'll have to ask her about that. By the way, I appreciate your gym advice â€“ it's helped me stay focused."

Peter: "No problem at all! It seems we're on the same wavelength, Samantha. Looking forward to our double date with Caroline and Diego too."
