Caroline is at the restaurant.
Peter is at the gym.
Mei is at the market.
Diego is at the library.
Noor is at the theater.
Leo is at the library.
 Diego: Hey Leo, I was thinking about our cat mural event – bird duets could really make it cozy, like a café vibe. What do you think?

Leo: Absolutely, Diego! And how about some squirrel tunes too? I reckon they'd add a nice touch. Let's brainstorm over some street tacos tonight at your place, sounds good?

Diego: Sounds perfect to me. See you later then.

Leo: Looking forward to it, Diego! By the way, Noor mentioned Andy's on board with the project, and they want Peter involved with his amp for the fundraiser concert. Let's get this show on the road!
 Samantha: "Hey Noor, I just spoke with Caroline about the latte art – she thinks we should involve Mei's students too. What do you think?"

Noor: "That sounds amazing! Let's make it a bigger collaboration. We could have them perform some music at Main Street Tacos, blending their tunes with our bird duets and cat designs."

Samantha: "I agree, it'll bring more people together and showcase the community's talents. I've also reached out to Leo about his tunes for the event. Shall we meet at the park tomorrow to practice?"

Noor: "Sounds perfect! I've already talked with Diego about incorporating his fitness expertise into our post-performance yoga session. Let's finalize everything together at Main Street Tacos on Thursday."
