 Peter: Hey Diego, heard you're bringing street tacos for the cats tonight? I think they'll love it!

Diego: You got it, Peter. And I've got a surprise for our mural too – Leo's squirrel latte art might fit right in. What do you think?

Peter: Sounds amazing! We should discuss the details over dinner at Main Street Tacos. Mei suggested we invite Caroline as well, right?

Diego: Absolutely. I'll see you there then. And don't forget about our practice session tomorrow morning, we've got a lot to cover with Noor and the cat mural project.

Peter: Can't wait, Diego. It's shaping up to be an eventful weekend! Let's make it a success for the neighborhood cats and our art project.
 Mei: Good morning, Leo! I was thinking about our chat last night. I found some sunrise seeds from my garden that might work perfectly for the cat mural.

Leo: Hey there, Mei! Morning light is always a great inspiration. And speaking of inspirations, I've been working on a musical idea to complement the mural and yoga poses. Let's discuss it at the library meeting this weekend.

Mei: That sounds amazing, Leo! I can't wait to see how everything comes together. By the way, Peter suggested we bring some of my garden seeds for the mural – what do you think?

Leo: I think it's a wonderful idea, Mei. And as for the quadruple date, let's not forget about our furry friends. Bring some tacos for the neighborhood cats at Main Street Tacos tomorrow, shall we?

Mei: Agreed! I'll see you there, Leo. It's going to be a fantastic day!
