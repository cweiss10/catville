 Samantha: Hi Peter, I saw your emails about the mural project. Your gym ideas sound interesting for the tree design.

Peter: Hey Samantha! Good to see you at the museum so early. I was thinking about our conversation last night with Andy. Let's discuss more about incorporating my gym routines into Diego's art, make it unique.

Samantha: That could work well, considering the interactivity we aim for. Shall we meet under the gazebo trees tonight at 7:00 PM to hash out some ideas?

Peter: Absolutely! I like the sound of that. Looking forward to it, Samantha. And by the way, your robotics progress is impressive. Keep up the good work!

Samantha: Thank you, Peter. Your support means a lot, especially in this collaborative endeavor. See you tonight!
