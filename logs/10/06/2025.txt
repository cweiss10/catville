 Samantha: Hey Noor, I hope you had a great day! Mei mentioned your exciting yoga ideas for the mural – I can't wait to see them in action!

Noor: Hi Samantha! Yes, it was an eventful day. I'm thrilled about the bird duet and can't believe we'll have your sunrise seeds too. Let's make sure to discuss those smoothie plans of ours at Andy's soon. How about tomorrow after school?

Samantha: That works perfectly for me! See you then, and let's coordinate with the others to ensure we're all on the same page for a fantastic mural project.
 Diego: Hey Leo, I saw you busking near the market. Thought you might be in need of some street tacos after that long session.

Leo: Ah Diego, always on time! Thanks for the offer, but I've got a show tonight. Maybe we can catch up tomorrow at Andy's? We have quite the agenda with the cat mural project, don't we?

Diego: Absolutely, looking forward to it. And speaking of cats, I was thinking Peter might bring some tacos for our furry friends during the community event, what do you think?

Leo: That sounds purr-fect! Let's make sure everyone is well-fed, including us. See you tomorrow then?

Diego: You bet, and maybe we can take care of those strays behind Andy's café before our meeting. It's the least we can do for the town that inspires our art.
