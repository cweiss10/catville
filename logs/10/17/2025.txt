 Peter: Hey Mei, how's the cat mural project coming along? I've got some sketches for the interactive tree if you want to take a look.

Mei: Hi Peter! That sounds great, let's catch up on that at Main Street Tacos tomorrow. By the way, have you talked to Noor about involving her zine club members in our discussions?

Peter: Not yet, but I think they could add a unique perspective. Let's make sure we invite them. Thanks for reminding me! See you there.

 Caroline: Hey Diego, got your usual? I've been meaning to ask about that cat mural project we discussed with Samantha.

Diego: Ah, Caroline! Yes, of course. And yes, I was just thinking about the mural. Noor and I have some ideas for incorporating robotics into it.

Caroline: That sounds fantastic! We've also invited Mei, Andy, and Noor's students to join in the design discussions. How about that garden at the park you mentioned?

Diego: Absolutely! Let's start planning it soon. I was thinking of those squirrel characters from your latte art as a nod to our favorite cafe. How does that sound?

Caroline: Love it! We should also discuss details for Andy's bird duet at Main Street Tacos tomorrow. And remember, take care of that knee for the project.

Diego: You're right, Caroline. I'll make sure to do just that. Let's keep each other motivated and feed the stray cats regularly, as we envisioned. Looking forward to our quadruple date after it all comes together!
 Andy: Hey Peter, great seeing you at the gym so early! How was your workout?

Peter: Morning, Andy! I've been meaning to ask - how did that cat mural brainstorming go with Caroline?

Andy: It went well, actually! We're looking to expand and collaborate more. You should come by the community center sometime, I think you'd enjoy it.

Peter: That sounds awesome, Andy. I'd love to be involved. What about that musical collaboration we talked about? Could we start brainstorming on that too?

Andy: Absolutely! Let's do it over tacos tomorrow at Main Street Tacos around noon? I invited Leo and a few others from the Zine Club.

Peter: Sounds like a plan, Andy. I'll bring some of my squirrel robots to show off too. Maybe we can even get Noor involved.
