Andy: Absolutely, Diego! Caroline's café double date and our cat mural project are top of mind. I've been excited to show her the new latte art designs too!

Leo: Perfect! Seems like we're both keeping busy with our shared passion for creativity. See you soon, Peter!

Peter: You too, Leo. I think this collaboration is going to be something special.
