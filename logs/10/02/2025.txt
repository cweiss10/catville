 Mei: Hey Diego, I've been thinking about our cat mural event plans. Andy and Peter are on board now, right?

Diego: Absolutely, Mei! And they suggested bringing an amp for the fundraiser concert too. How about we meet at Main Street Tacos tonight to finalize everything? I've been craving those street tacos.

Mei: That sounds perfect. Let's make sure to bring treats for the neighborhood cats too, as promised. See you there at 7:00 PM!

Diego: Sounds like a plan. I might even have some sunrise seeds for our collaboration, thanks to Peter's suggestion. Looking forward to it!
