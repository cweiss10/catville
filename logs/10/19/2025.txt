Noor: "That sounds like a wonderful idea, Samantha! Let's make sure to involve Diego's robotics club too, and maybe even Leo's students. I'll bring snacks for anyone who drops by."

Samantha: "I'll bring my laptop and headphones as well. Your squirrel latte art idea is inspiring, Noor. This will truly be a memorable day for our town."

Noor: "I'm excited to see how it all comes together, Samantha. Let's continue creating magic here at the park!"
 Peter: Hey Mei, thanks for the seeds, they'll make Diego's garden bloom. I'm excited about our tree idea, let's finalize it over breakfast tomorrow.

Mei: Of course, Peter! And I can't wait to see what your club comes up with for the design. Don't forget the headphones for our bird duet performance too. See you at Main Street Tacos.

Peter: You got it. And about that quadruple date once we wrap up the project, are you free on Saturdays?
