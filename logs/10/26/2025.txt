 Andy: Hey Mei! I got your seeds and some cat treats for our meeting at Main Street Tacos. Thanks for reminding me about them.

Mei: Hello, Andy! I appreciate that. I also have some snacks for the cats under the gazebo. And thank you for mentioning Diego's sunrise seeds for the mural - it'll be perfect!

Andy: Glad to help. We're really making progress with this project, aren't we? Looking forward to our joint meeting and catching up more!

Mei: Indeed, it feels great collaborating with such a passionate group. Can't wait for the discussions at the gazebo later too. Let's continue bringing magic to our community projects!
