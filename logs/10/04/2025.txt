 Samantha: "Hey Diego, I've been working on some design sketches for the mural. Would you like to meet at the park tomorrow morning before our planning session? I thought we could stretch together."

Diego: "That sounds great, Samantha. I appreciate your attention to detail and creative ideas. Meeting early will give us time to coordinate before the event. Let's catch up over tacos later, as planned."
 Caroline: "Hey Peter, I hope you had a good day. How's that startup talk coming along?"

Peter: "Caroline! Good to see you too. Well, still trying to find my footing but it's been interesting. Listen, I was thinking about our cat mural project and wanted your thoughts."

Caroline: "Of course, what's on your mind? I've been looking forward to working with everyone."

Peter: "I thought we could involve Mei in the brainstorming sessions, and maybe even some fitness tips from those students at the community garden?"

Caroline: "That sounds great! She's got such creative ideas. We should definitely treat the neighborhood cats too."

Caroline: "By the way, Samantha mentioned that she might be busy with the mural event in the morning. Maybe we could meet a bit earlier at the park if that works for you?"

Peter: "Perfect timing! I was planning to stretch before discussing details anyway. Let's make it happen."

Samantha: "I agree. I was discussing that with Diego and the others earlier today. We should have a great event ahead."

Mei: "That sounds wonderful! I've been coordinating plans for the quadruple date at Main Street Tacos this week too. Let's make sure we all get together before diving into mural details."

Samantha: "Sounds like a plan, Mei. Maybe I'll even leave you a note about latte art rehearsals?"

Mei: "That would be lovely! I'll see you at the park on Saturday for our group stretch then."
