Diego: "That sounds great, Samantha. I appreciate your attention to detail and creative ideas. Meeting early will give us time to coordinate before the event. Let's catch up over tacos later, as planned."
 Caroline: "Hey Peter, I hope you had a good day. How's that startup talk coming along?"

Peter: "Caroline! Good to see you too. Well, still trying to find my footing but it's been interesting. Listen, I was thinking about our cat mural project and wanted your thoughts."

Caroline: "Of course, what's on your mind? I've been looking forward to working with everyone."

Peter: "I thought we could involve Mei in the brainstorming sessions, and maybe even some fitness tips from those students at the community garden?"

Caroline: "That sounds great! She's got such creative ideas. We should definitely treat the neighborhood cats too."

Caroline: "By the way, Samantha mentioned that she might be busy with the mural event in the morning. Maybe we could meet a bit earlier at the park if that works for you?"

Peter: "Perfect timing! I was planning to stretch before discussing details anyway. Let's make it happen."
