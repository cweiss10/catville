 Caroline: Hey Mei, I hope you're doing well! I was just discussing our cat mural project with Diego at the theater. He mentioned involving you and others from the robotics club.

Mei: That sounds wonderful, Caroline! I'd love to collaborate on something so meaningful for our town. By the way, I was thinking we could incorporate your squirrel latte art into our interactive elements. What do you think?

Caroline: I think it's a brilliant idea, Mei! Let's discuss it further at the cafe tonight around 9:00 PM? Maybe over one of my famous lattes?

Mei: That sounds perfect, Caroline! See you then. Oh, and don't forget our community garden seeds are in my tote if you need them for the project.
 Andy: Hey Samantha, I was thinking about our cat mural project. It could be something really special with music and tech involved.

Samantha: Interesting idea, Andy. Let's gather the team at Main Street Tacos tomorrow at 6 PM to discuss details. I'll bring my laptop and headphones.

Andy: Sounds great! I've been brainstorming with Peter, Mei, Diego, and Noor. They're all excited to collaborate and maybe even expand the project.

Samantha: That's fantastic! The more minds we have working on it, the better our chances of making a positive impact in town. I'll bring my violin too. Let's make some history together!
