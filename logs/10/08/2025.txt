Mei: Oh, definitely! We can start with planning the squirrel latte art yoga moves for the modern art wing and finalize the mural walk with Peter. And I brought some seeds from my garden that could work well in the cat mural design.

Noor: That sounds fantastic! Speaking of collaboration, Caroline mentioned a bird duet performance at the park as part of our extended gathering this weekend. Are you excited?

Mei: Absolutely! I'm also looking forward to making solving puzzles together a tradition while waiting, just like old times. Let's not forget about taking care of those strays behind Andy's café as part of our project commitment too.

Andy: Yeah, we had quite a discussion last night about involving him and collaborating on both projects. He's excited about it! We also talked about incorporating yoga moves from our squirrel design into this one.

Diego: That sounds awesome! I'll make sure Noor is ready for our practice session tomorrow. Let's touch base when things calm down with my knee, and maybe grab a coffee catch-up?

Andy: Absolutely, Diego. I'll check on your injury and we can plan something soon. And by the way, I mentioned to Leo about saving some street tacos for the neighborhood cats during our meeting next Saturday.
 Peter: Hey Mei, running a bit late from the gym. Heard about your garden seeds for the mural project?

Mei: Hi Peter! Yes, I brought some over for our meeting tonight. Seems like we both have been discussing ideas with different people. Let's share what we've got so far.

Peter: Great! I spoke with Noor about yoga movements and squirrel latte art. Sounds like you've been busy too, talking to Samantha and Caroline about a quadruple date at the park and involving them in the project as well.

Mei: That's right! And it seems we both have suggestions from our conversations. I think combining ideas will make this cat mural a true community effort for our town. Let's get together tonight at Main Street Tacos to discuss further.

Mei: Perfect timing! Noor suggested we incorporate musical elements inspired by a robin's song at the park. We should make it quite a spectacle.
