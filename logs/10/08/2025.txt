 Mei: "Hello, Leo! I didn't expect to see you here so soon."

Leo: "Same here, Mei! Fancied a quick practice session after chatting with Peter about the cat mural and our bird duet at the park."

Mei: "Ah, yes! The seeds from my garden might be just what Caroline needs for her design. Have you heard anything new?"

Leo: "Indeed, I shared some ideas with Noor's students about squirrel latte art, and they seem quite excited. I also have a new piece ready - 'Canon in D'. What do you think?"

Mei: "Oh, it sounds delightful! Can't wait to see how our town will come alive through these collaborations."
