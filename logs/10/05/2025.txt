Leo: Indeed, Noor! Ready for our brainstorming session at Andy's? Caroline's squirrel latte art is going to add a unique twist to the cat mural, don't you think?

Noor: Absolutely! And I can't wait to see how we can incorporate your musical element into it. We'll make sure to bring treats for the neighborhood cats as well.

Leo: Speaking of that, have you talked with Mei about saving some sunrise seeds for our ritual garden? It's going to be quite a spectacle!

Noor: Yes, we did. I think it's going to be a beautiful collaboration. Let's head over to Main Street Tacos and finalize the plan before our meeting with Andy.

Leo: Excellent idea, Noor. I'm looking forward to this journey with you, my friend!
