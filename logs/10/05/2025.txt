Noor: Absolutely! And I can't wait to see how we can incorporate your musical element into it. We'll make sure to bring treats for the neighborhood cats as well.

Leo: Speaking of that, have you talked with Mei about saving some sunrise seeds for our ritual garden? It's going to be quite a spectacle!

Noor: Yes, we did. I think it's going to be a beautiful collaboration. Let's head over to Main Street Tacos and finalize the plan before our meeting with Andy.
