 Diego: Hey Noor, remember our chat about the cat mural and performances? Excited for our collaboration under those gazebo trees?

Noor: Absolutely, Diego! I can't wait to bond over feeding stray cats at that café before we start painting. And let's not forget about our headphones for focus – just like old times!

Diego: That sounds perfect. I think it'll be a great way to spend the weekend. Let's make sure to bring our snacks as well, you know for any overwhelmed students or gym beginners.

Noor: Agreed! Your street tacos and my lab cookies will definitely come in handy. I've been advocating at town hall for better equipment – who knows, maybe we'll need it during the project!
