Andy is at the library.
Caroline is at the school.
Peter is at the park.
Mei is at the cafe.
Diego is at the museum.
Noor is at the home.
Leo is at the gym.
 Samantha: Hey Diego, did you hear about Leo's new melody for our presentation? It sounds exciting!

Diego: Yeah, he mentioned it during our practice earlier today. I can't wait to see how it fits with the mural design. And speaking of which, have you given any thought to those yoga moves for the squirrel latte art?

Samantha: I've been working on some ideas, but I need more time to refine them. Let's discuss it further during our meeting at Main Street Tacos this weekend. Mei's joining us too, right?

Diego: Absolutely! It'll be great to have her input. And don't worry about the yoga moves; I trust you'll come up with something amazing, just like your open-source libraries at night.

Samantha: Thanks, Diego. I appreciate your confidence in me. Let's make this project a success, and maybe we can even treat the neighborhood strays afterward as a reward for all our hard work.

Diego: Sounds like a plan. We make a great team, Samantha. And speaking of teams, let's make sure to coordinate with Noor and Leo so we're all on the same page. See you Saturday!

Andy: I suggested we collaborate on it together and Caroline agreed to meet tonight at Main Street Tacos after her rehearsal. I was thinking, maybe you could join us too?

Noor: That'd be great, Andy! I'm looking forward to contributing my ideas and meeting Caroline as well. Let's make our town even more special together!

Andy: Absolutely, Noor! See you tonight at the tacos place then. And by the way, have you heard about our group modifying plans for the cat mural project tomorrow? We're meeting at 10 AM sharp instead of 9 AM, bringing yoga mats and discussing ideas for the design.

Noor: Yes, I did! Diego suggested incorporating squirrel latte art and yoga movements into the design, which sounds amazing. I'll bring seeds from the community garden and treats for neighborhood cats. Let's make it happen!
