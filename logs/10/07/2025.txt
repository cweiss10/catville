Andy is at the library.
Caroline is at the school.
Peter is at the park.
Mei is at the cafe.
Diego is at the museum.
Noor is at the home.
Leo is at the gym.
 Samantha: Hey Diego, did you hear about Leo's new melody for our presentation? It sounds exciting!

Diego: Yeah, he mentioned it during our practice earlier today. I can't wait to see how it fits with the mural design. And speaking of which, have you given any thought to those yoga moves for the squirrel latte art?

Samantha: I've been working on some ideas, but I need more time to refine them. Let's discuss it further during our meeting at Main Street Tacos this weekend. Mei's joining us too, right?

Diego: Absolutely! It'll be great to have her input. And don't worry about the yoga moves; I trust you'll come up with something amazing, just like your open-source libraries at night.

Samantha: Thanks, Diego. I appreciate your confidence in me. Let's make this project a success, and maybe we can even treat the neighborhood strays afterward as a reward for all our hard work.

Diego: Sounds like a plan. We make a great team, Samantha. And speaking of teams, let's make sure to coordinate with Noor and Leo so we're all on the same page. See you Saturday!
