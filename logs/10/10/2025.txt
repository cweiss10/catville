 Noor: Hey Leo! Great catching up with you at the town hall. I can't wait for our cat mural project - your squirrel latte art ideas are fantastic!

Leo: Hi Noor! It was a pleasure, as always. I'm excited to see how this collaboration unfolds. By the way, I've got a new bird duet piece called 'Canon in D'. Would you and Andy like to hear it at the park tomorrow?

Noor: Absolutely! Let's make it happen. And don't forget about those stray cats behind Andy's café tomorrow before our meeting. I picked up some cat food especially for them.
 Andy: Hey Samantha, I hope you enjoyed the museum this morning! I was thinking about our collaboration on the cat mural – have you had a chance to look at those sunrise seeds Leo mentioned?

Samantha: Hi Andy! Yes, I did. I ordered them online, they should arrive soon. By the way, Diego asked me to mention that he's planning a community celebration with squirrel latte art and Noor's science club. He thought it might be fun if we incorporated our mural as well.

Andy: That sounds fantastic! I'm excited to see how everything comes together. Maybe we can have our first meeting at the gazebo this week, once the seeds arrive? What do you think?

Samantha: That sounds great, Andy. Let's plan it for Thursday around 5 PM. I'll bring some of those fresh coffee beans Diego picked up for us to enjoy while we work. See you then!
