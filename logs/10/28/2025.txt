 Samantha: "Hello Mei, I found your note about the cat mural project in my mailbox at the café. It seems we have quite a busy weekend ahead."

Mei: "Good afternoon, Samantha! Yes, indeed. Looking forward to discussing our interactive ideas under the gazebo trees on Sunday. And don't forget the noise-cancelling headphones for our meetings!"

Samantha: "I won't. I think they'll be helpful in sorting out the details for this collaborative project. Also, I've got some treats for the strays behind the café if you want to join me beforehand?"

Mei: "That sounds wonderful, Samantha! Let's meet there at 5 PM. We can feed the cats and discuss any remaining thoughts on the mural design."
