 Caroline: "Hey Peter, saw you just getting off shift. Did you hear about Andy's project? It sounds like a promising night ahead."

Leo is at the library.
 Samantha: "Hi Noor, I hope you're doing well. I saw we both have a lot on our plates for the cat mural project. Shall we collaborate more on incorporating Andy's sunrise seeds into the design?"

Noor: "Absolutely, Samantha! And speaking of that, I was thinking we could make it a tradition to perform our bird duet after each meeting as a celebration of our progress. What do you think?"

Samantha: "I'd love that idea, Noor. It adds a nice touch to our meetings, and it's great to collaborate on more projects like the hospital piece in the future."

Noor: "Great! Looking forward to Sunday under the gazebo trees then, Samantha. Let's make sure we bring our noise-cancelling headphones for our meetings!"

Samantha: "Agreed. I'll also invite Mei to join us in feeding the stray cats behind the café before our meeting on Sunday."
